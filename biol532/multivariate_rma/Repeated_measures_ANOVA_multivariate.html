    <h1>Repeated measures ANOVA using multivariate tests</h1>
    <p>We're a little short on time this semester, so we're skipping over the
      exercise on univariate repeated measures analysis (RMA) that I usually
      have students do. If we had done the univariate approach we would have
      found that it was not appropriate for the data set we're using, and would
      want to use the multivariate approach instead. I'll briefly explain here
      why this is the case.</p>
    <p>Repeated measurements of the same subjects are not independent, and
      analyzing the data with a method that assumes the data are independent can
      be very inaccurate. There is a univariate ANOVA model that is able to
      account for the lack of independence between repeated measurements of
      individuals, called <strong>repeated measures ANOVA</strong>, and that is
      the univariate method we are skipping over. Repeated measures ANOVA makes
      a distinction between the treatments applied to subjects (called the
      between-subjects effects) and the change over time in response by each of
      the subjects (called the within-subjects effects), and tests for main
      effects and interactions between them. It works well, and gives high
      statistical power, when its assumptions are met.</p>
    <p>However, repeated measures ANOVA has an additional assumption, called <strong>sphericity</strong>,
      that can be difficult to meet. Sphericity is the assumption that the
      variances of differences between successive time points are the same, and
      it is tested with the Mauchly test. The data we are about to analyze
      failed the Mauchly test, so shouldn't be analyzed using univariate RMA.</p>
    <p>We can use MANOVA to reproduce tests of the same effects we would have
      tested with univariate RMA, and this approach is called <strong>profile
        analysis</strong>. The questions we will address are the same as with
      univariate RMA, but because MANOVA does not assume anything about the
      variances of the response variables being the same as one another we can
      use it when we violate the sphericity assumption. Profile analysis is a
      little less statistically powerful that univariate RMA when the sphericity
      assumption is met, but it is preferable to univariate RMA when sphericity
      is violated.</p>
    <h2>The RMA data</h2>
    <img src="r138958_475480.jpg" alt="Leech" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; width: 128px; height: 95px;">
    <p>Our data set for today comes from a study of medicinal leeches (like the
      one pictured to the right), which are aquatic annelids that eat blood.
      They eat infrequently, but when they are able to get a meal they gorge
      themselves, such that their body weight increases approximately ten fold
      after a feeding. Blood is very watery, and they expel the water relatively
      quickly until only the solid components of the blood with all the
      nutrients are left, which they can then digest more slowly. Leeches can be
      fooled into feeding on a solution of the amino acid arginine, but it is
      not their normal food and is much less nutritional for them. </p>
    <p>Characterizing the differences in weights of leeches that feed on blood
      and arginine was the purpose of the experiment - the researchers did the
      following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two groups of 10 leeches were selected and assigned to be fed on one
        of two different diets</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood fed - fed on cow's blood (their usual diet)</li>
        <li>Arginine fed - fed on an Arginine solution (which has little
          nutritive value)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Before feeding each animal was weighed to obtain a pre-feeding weight.</li>
      <li>Leeches were then fed on their assigned diet, and were weighed
        immediately after feeding (Day 0)</li>
      <li>The leeches were then weighed daily for six days, and once again on
        the eighth day (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, and Day 8)</li>
      <li>The data were expressed as a ratio of the pre-feeding measurement -
        that is, each day's weight was divided by the pre-feeding weight, such
        that a value of 10 indicates that a leech was 10 times their pre-feeding
        weight, and a value of 1 meant their weight was the same as their
        pre-feeding weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start a new project folder, download <a href="leech_weights.xlsx">this</a>
      data file and <a href="multivariate_rma.Rmd">this</a> Rmd file into it.
      Import the data from leech_weights.xlsx, sheet leech_weights, into a data
      set called weights. These are the same data you used last week.</p>
    <h2>Profile analysis - using multivariate tests for repeated measures
      analysis</h2>
    <p> The Anova() function from the car library will produce both univariate
      and multivariate tests - we will focus on the multivariate tests today.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind as you are interpreting the results that the data we are
      using actually only has one response variable, weight, and we are using
      multivariate analysis in an unusual way to conduct a univariate repeated
      measures analysis. We will only need to interpret the results as though
      they were univariate - there will be no multivariate interpretation using
      scores, loadings, or communalities this time, and there are no
      multivariate post-hocs needed, only univariate ones.</p>
    <p>To use multivariate methods to get tests of food, day, and the food x day
      interaction it is necessary to run three separate analyses, like so:</p>

    </table>
    <p>The Anova() command from the car library will do these three analyses,
      and assemble the pertinent results into what looks like a single MANOVA
      table. Anova() is a little non-intuitive to use, with a few pieces that we
      have to assemble to make it work.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Load the library</strong>. First, we will load the library
      (library.car):</p>
    <p class="rmd">library(car)</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Prep for Anova()</strong>. We need to tell Anova() about our
      design - the within-subjects design is defined first by making a vector of
      days, converting it to a factor, and then converting the factor to a data
      frame. Make your list of days (make.variables.list):</p>
    <p class="rmd">days &lt;- c("d0","d1","d2","d3","d4","d5","d6","d8")</p>
    <p>and then make an R factor out of it (time.factor):</p>
    <p class="rmd">time.factor &lt;- factor(days)</p>
    <p>Now we make a data frame out of our time.factor (time.frame):</p>
    <p class="rmd">time.frame &lt;- data.frame(time.factor)</p>
    <p>This is a very simple within-subjects design, and all of this complexity
      probably seems a little silly, but it's possible to have within-subjects
      treatments - for example, if we had increased the water temperature after
      the third day we would have a within-subjects treatment variable that
      indicates the cold days (days 0 through 3) and warm days (days 4 through
      8) and tested for an effect of water temperature. So, we have to put up
      with a little excessive complexity for simple designs like ours so that
      more complex designs can be analyzed.</p>
    <p>The between-subjects design is defined by a MANOVA of the daily weight
      measurements by food type (manova.model):</p>
    <p class="rmd">manova(as.matrix(weights[days]) ~ food, data = weights) -&gt;
      weights.mlm</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Run the RMA</strong>. To run the RMA, use the Anova() command
      from the car library (run.rma):</p>
    <p class="rmd">library(car)</p>
    <p class="rmd">Anova(weights.mlm, idata = time.frame, idesign =
      ~time.factor) -&gt; weights.rma</p>
    <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,sans-serif;"></span>
    <p>This produces both the univariate and multivariate analyses and assigns
      them both to weights.rma, but we'll just look at the multivariate analysis
      today.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Multivariate tests</strong>. To get a table with the
      multivariate RMA results we just use print() on the rma object (chunk
      multivariate.table):</p>
    <p class="rmd">print(weights.rma)</p>
    <p class="rmd"> </p>
    <p>You'll get the following table:</p>

      Signif. codes:&nbsp; 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1</p>
    <p>You'll see that all of the tests are significant, including the
      food:time.factor interaction - when we do our post-hoc procedures we'll
      need to account for the combinations of food type and day.</p>
    <p>Note that the default multivariate test statistic is Pillai's trace,
      which is a good choice. If we wanted a different one we could have
      included an argument in Anova() specifying which we wanted to use.
      Pillai's is good when your data violate multivariate normality, and tends
      to be identical to the others when assumptions are met, so stick with the
      default.</p>
    <p>And that's it! Simple, right? The complexity in an RMA comes from the
      post-hocs, which we'll deal with now that we know that we have a
      difference in the pattern of change over time between the food types
      (that's what the interaction is telling us).</p>
    <h2>Post-hoc analysis<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The post-hoc procedure would be the same regardless of whether we used
      univariate or multivariate analysis - none of the post-hocs compare more
      than two sets of repeated measures, so sphericity isn't an assumption for
      any of them.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of differences between RMA and a normal factorial
      ANOVA that we will want to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't usually want to compare all possible sets of means, for a
        couple of reasons. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>We often will have several time points recorded, which leads to huge
          numbers of possible comparisons. In this data set there are 120
          possible pairs of means for the 16 combinations of food and day, and
          if we made every possible comparison we would have very low power to
          detect differences. And, comparing every possible pair of means would
          be pointless, because...</li>
        <li>Many of the comparisons we could make aren't interesting. A
          comparison between arbitrary combinations of food type and day are
          probably not illuminating - for example, what do we care if blood-fed
          animals on day 6 are different from arginine-fed animals on day 2?
          Differences between food groups on the same day, or between days
          within a food group, are probably more interesting.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The data are paired between any two time points, because the same
        animals are measured each time. Standard, familiar post-hoc procedures
        like Tukey tests are not appropriate for paired data, so we'll need to
        use paired t-tests with a Bonferonni adjusted alpha level for any
        comparison between days.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Usually, the comparisons of interest in a repeated measures analysis are:</p>

    </table>
    <p>We'll work through these questions one at a time.</p>
    <h3>A. On which days were food types different?</h3>
    <p>This is a simple comparison between means of two independent samples of
      leech weights at each time point. We could do these comparisons with
      either a t-test or ANOVA, but since we already have a multivariate linear
      model handy (weights.mlm) we can get all of these comparisons done with a
      single command (differences.in.weights.each.day): </p>
    <p class="rmd">summary(aov(weights.mlm))</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Using the aov() command to weights.mlm changes it from a multivariate
      linear model to a list of separate univariate ANOVAs. The summary()
      function then returns the eight different ANOVA tables we need, one for
      each day's weights. With only two groups we don't require Tukey tests, but
      we could use them if we needed to - for example, we could use (in the
      Console):</p>
    <p class="rcmd">apply(weights[days], MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x)
      TukeyHSD(aov(x ~ food, data = weights)))</p>
    <p>This conducts the one-way ANOVA for each column of weights, and then does
      Tukey tests on them - not necessary here, but this is how you would do it
      if we had three or more food groups.</p>
    <p>Since we have eight days, each one of which is generating a p-value, we
      should test each comparison at an adjusted alpha level of 0.05/8 = 0.0062.
      You'll see that at the adjusted alpha level of 0.0062, weights are not
      different between the food groups on the first day, but are on the second
      and all subsequent days. Since the Tukey tests are already adjusted for
      multiple comparisons you would use this 0.05/8 level for each set of Tukey
      tests as well, if we had needed to use them.</p>
    <h3>B. Within each food type, which days differed sequentially? Or
      alternatively, which differed from the initial weight?</h3>
    <p>1. <strong>Calculate sequential differences</strong>. To test for
      differences in sequential time points within food types we need to do
      paired comparisons. If you remember from our stat review, a paired t-test
      takes a set of paired measurements, calculates differences between the
      pairs, and then tests the differences against a mean of 0. We should
      calculate sequential differences for this analysis
      (calculate.sequential.diffs):</p>
    <p class="rmd">weights[days[-8]] - weights[days[-1]] -&gt; diffs</p>
    <p>This command selected the columns from weights for every day but the last
      one (thus, days[-8]) and subtracted the columns from weights for every day
      but the first one (thus, days[-1]) - that is, the first command selects
      days d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and d6, while the second command selects days
      d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d8; subtracting the second set from the first
      gives us d0-d1, d2-d1, d3-d2, d4-d3, d5-d4, d6-d5, and d8-d6. These
      differences are then assigned to diffs. This gives us seven differences
      for the eight columns of data.</p>
    <p>Right now the column names are a little confusing - diffs retained the
      column name of the first set of weights (d0 through d6), but they are
      actually differences between two columns. We can re-name them with (same
      code chunk, next line):</p>
    <p class="rmd">colnames(diffs) &lt;- paste(days[-8], days[-1], sep = " - ")</p>
    <p>This command uses paste() to construct new column names, and then assigns
      them to be the column names for the diffs object. Paste combines the
      arguments you provide into a single text label, and separates the
      arguments with the character you specify with sep =. This paste() function
      combines the two days that are being compared, separated by a minus sign.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Split the differences by food type</strong>. Now that we have
      the set of sequential differences, we just need to conduct a one-sample
      t-test on each column of differences, split by food group. This set of
      comparisons will not compare blood to arg groups at all - we will split
      the data by group, and then test for differences between sequential time
      points for each subset of the data.</p>
    <p>Subsetting the data and then running 7 one-sample t-test could take
      awhile if we did them all by hand, and would provide us many opportunities
      to make typos. We can instead use a couple of R functions that allow us to
      do repetitious work on structured data like this with relative ease.</p>
    <p>First, let's split diffs by food group (split.the.diffs.by.food.type).</p>
    <p class="rmd">split(diffs, weights$food) -&gt; diffs.split</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The object diffs.split is a list, with the first element called "arg"
      being the differences for the arg group, and the second one called "blood"
      being the differences for blood-fed leeches. This worked, by the way,
      because diffs was calculated from the data in weights, and the rows line
      up between them - if we weren't certain of this we would not want to split
      one data set based on the information in another, as we could end up
      scrambling the data between the groups.</p>
    <p>Now that we have a list with our two groups, we can use a function called
      apply() to do a one-sample t-test for each column in arg, and then again
      to do one-sample t-test for each column in blood. For arg, use the
      function (in the Console):</p>
    <p class="rconsole">apply(diffs.split$arg, MARGIN&nbsp; = 2, FUN = t.test)</p>
    <p>The arguments are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The data set we're using - we're specifying the arg differences from
        diffs.split with diffs.split$arg</li>
      <li>The MARGIN command tells apply() whether to apply the function to the
        columns of the data set (2), or to the rows (1). Our differences are in
        columns, so MARGIN = 2</li>
      <li>The FUN command identifies what function we are using. The t.test()
        function does a one-sample test against 0 by default, so we only have to
        give the name of the function to get what we want.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn't bad - to get the blood group t-tests you would just need to
      re-issue the command, with diffs.split$blood as the list argument to get
      the results for blood-fed leeches. But, we can do better.</p>
    <p> First, we can use lapply() to process the two groups in diffs.split, and
      use apply() as its FUN - this will get us output for all fourteen of our
      tests done at once. Like so (paired.t.tests):</p>
    <p class="rmd">lapply(diffs.split, FUN = function(x) apply(x, MARGIN = 2,
      FUN = t.test)) -&gt; diffs.split.ts</p>
    <p>This command runs all 14 of the paired t-tests on sequential time points.
      The lapply() command takes our list of differences for each food group,
      and then uses our apply() function to apply a t-test to each column in
      each data set. The output of lapply() is also a list, so diffs.split is a
      list with named elements art and blood, each of which is itself a list of
      t-test outputs, each of which is named for the day column the t-test was
      applied to. You can see the contents of diffs.split.ts by entering the
      name into the console:</p>
    <p class="rcmd">diffs.split.ts</p>
    <p>and you'll see that there are 14 one-sample t-tests within it.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Extract the p-values</strong>. At this point you have the
      results you need, but not in a very convenient format - scrolling through
      14 t-tests to find all the p-values is cumbersome. </p>
    <p>We can use sapply() to go through each of the t-tests and pull out the
      p-values for us, and present them in a matrix. The functions lapply() and
      sapply() work the same way, but sapply() returns a matrix as output, and
      lapply() returns a list.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If we used (in the Console):</p>
    <p class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.split.ts, FUN = function(x) x$p.value)</p>
    <p>we don't get what we want - we get:</p>
    <p class="rout">$arg<br>
      NULL<br>
      <br>
      $blood<br>
      NULL</p>
    <p>This failed because we have a nested list in diffs.split.ts - the first
      level is the split between arg and blood, and within each of those food
      types are the t-tests labeled by the days that are being compared. We can
      get the p-values just for arg by specifying just the arginine t-tests in
      our sapply(), like so:</p>
    <p class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.split.ts$arg, FUN = function(x) x$p.value)</p>
    <p>which gets us:</p>
    <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d1 -
      d0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d2 - d1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d3
      - d2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d4 - d3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      d5 - d4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d6 -
      d5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d8 - d6 <br>
      6.175098e-05 6.642295e-06 7.360390e-05 1.836634e-03 5.594553e-01
      3.438646e-02 9.448570e-03 </p>
    <p>This function is working by passing one of the arg t-tests at a time to
      the function defined by FUN. The function is defined as function(x)
      x$p.value - the function(x) part states that what comes next is a new
      function that takes x as an argument. Right after function(x) comes the
      command that will be executed, and it is extremely simple - it will take x
      and extract the named element called p.value from it. So, sapply() passes
      one arg t-test at a time to this function, and its p-value is extracted
      from it - once every arg t-test has been processed sapply() returns the
      collection of p-values as a vector.</p>
    <p>These are indeed the p-values for the comparisons between successive days
      for the arginine group, but it would be nice to be able to get both blood
      and arginine together. We can do this by nesting our sapply() command
      inside of another - the outer sapply() will pull out all of the arg
      t-tests and pass them to the inner sapply(), which will pull out the arg
      group's p-values and put them into a vector. The outer sapply() will then
      pull out all of the blood t-tests and pass them to the inner sapply(). The
      two vectors of p-values will then be combined into a matrix by the outer
      sapply(), and displayed.</p>
    <p>The command to use is (sapply.command.for.p.values):</p>
    <p class="rmd">sapply(diffs.split.ts, FUN = function(x) sapply(x, FUN =
      function(y) y$p.value))</p>
    <p>You'll see you now have a nice matrix with a column for each food group,
      and a row for day - we should only consider p-values less than 0.05/14 =
      0.0036 to be significant</p>
    <p>Note that we had to change the variable from x to y in the inner sapply()
      - we can't use the same variable for both, but we can use nearly anything
      we want - for example, we could have written this as:</p>
    <p class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.split.ts, FUN =
      function(ttests.for.one.food.group) sapply(ttests.for.one.food.group, FUN
      = function(one.days.ttest) one.days.ttest$p.value))</p>
    <p>and the results would be the same.</p>
    <p>Note that one of your comparisons is reported as NaN, which means "not a
      number". This happened for the comparison between day 3 and day 2 for the
      blood group - if you look at the differences for those two days:</p>
    <p class="rcmd">diffs.split$blood$`d3 - d2`</p>
    <p>they are all 0 - there were no changes in weight for the blood-fed
      leeches between day 2 and 3, so the standard deviation of the differences
      is 0, the standard error is thus 0, and attempting to calculate t as the
      mean of the differences divided by the standard error gives a calculation
      error (dividing by 0 is undefined). Which is fine, the data are what they
      are - even though you don't get a p-value for this one the groups aren't
      different if their data values are identical (if forced to report a
      p-value you could report p = 1, since the chances of getting a difference
      of 0 or larger by chance has to be 1, given that every possible random
      outcome would have a difference of 0 or larger).</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Compare to first time point</strong>. That completes our
      post-hoc comparison of sequential differences, but comparisons of
      sequential differences aren't the only comparisons we might be interested
      in. For example, what if we were more interested in finding out which days
      were different from initial conditions? This is not, by the way, what
      Anova() tests for - it uses sequential differences, which matches the
      univariate approach. But, there's no reason we can't ask a different
      question if the default model isn't addressing what we want to know.</p>
    <p>To calculate the differences from initial conditions use (chunk
      diffs.from.initial):</p>
    <p class="rmd">weights[days[-1]] - replicate(7,weights$d0) -&gt;
      diffs.initial</p>
    <p>The syntax is a little different than our calculation of sequential
      differences because we want to subtract the same set of initial conditions
      from each of the other days, but subtracting one data frame from another
      only works in R if they both have the same number of columns. Using
      replicate makes as many copies of the column as we need of the d0 data so
      that we can subtract d0 from all seven of the other days of data.</p>
    <p>Set the column names to indicate which difference each contains (same
      chunk, next line):</p>
    <p class="rmd">colnames(diffs.initial) &lt;- paste("d0",days[-1], sep = " -
      ")</p>
    <p>Now to conduct our paired t-tests we need to split these diffs.initial by
      food type (chunk split.diffs.from.initial):</p>
    <p class="rmd">split(diffs.initial, weights$food) -&gt; diffs.initial.split</p>
    <p>Conduct the paired t-tests (i.e. one-sample tests of these differences
      against 0, chunk paired.t.diffs.from.initial):</p>
    <p class="rmd">lapply(diffs.initial.split, FUN = function(x) apply(x, MARGIN
      = 2, FUN = t.test)) -&gt; diffs.initial.split.ts</p>
    <p>And finally, collect the p-values (chunk
      sapply.for.diffs.from.initial.pvals):</p>
    <p class="rmd">sapply(diffs.initial.split.ts, FUN = function(x) sapply(x,
      FUN = function(y) y$p.value))</p>
    <p>There are 14 comparisons still, so we want to use an alpha level of
      0.05/14 = 0.0036 again - all of the weights are different from initial
      conditions by d1 for both food type, and stay different from d0 for the
      entire experiment.</p>
    <h3>C. Comparing sequential differences between food types</h3>
    <p>Finally, our food x day interaction was significant, so we know the
      change over time was not parallel between the food groups. However, we
      don't know if the changes were different every day, or if only some days
      had non-parallel changes. Differences between the food groups in amount of
      change from day to day could also be compared.</p>
    <p>To test whether every time point has non-parallel changes, we just need
      to do a comparison of the sequential differences by food group, one set of
      differences at a time. We can fit a model of sequential diffs by food
      group (diffs.by.group):</p>
    <p class="rmd">lm(as.matrix(diffs) ~ food, data = weights) -&gt;
      parallel.mlm</p>
    <p>Since there are only two groups we can use the same trick to get p-values
      for each comparison that we used above (compare.diffs.each.day):</p>
    <p class="rmd">summary(aov(parallel.mlm))</p>
    <p>We have seven tests here, so consider them significant if p is less than
      0.05/7 = 0.007. You'll see that not all of the time points were
      significantly non-parallel.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h3>What if the interaction of food x time was not significant?</h3>
      <p>We had to account for the combinations of food type and day in doing
        our post-hocs because of the significant interaction between the two. If
        there had not been a significant interaction between them, though, we
        could have just based our post-hocs on main effects of food and time,
        which are a much simpler set of tests to run.</p>
      <p>We only have two groups in the food variable, so post-hocs wouldn't be
        needed, but just to show you how it would be done, we would first take
        means for each leech across the days - since each row of the table is a
        day we just need to use (in the Console):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">rowMeans(weights[days]) -&gt; weights$leech.means</p>
      <p>This adds a column of means to the weights data set called leech.means.</p>
      <p>To get post-hocs we could just use TukeyHSD() on an fitted ANOVA, using
        the aov() function, like so (still in the Console):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">TukeyHSD(aov(leech.means ~ food, data = weights))</p>
      <p>which should give you:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp; Tukey multiple comparisons of means<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95% family-wise confidence level<br>
        <br>
        Fit: aov(formula = leech.means ~ food, data = weights)<br>
        <br>
        $food<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        diff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lwr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upr
        p adj<br>
        blood-arg 4.255295 3.307823 5.202768&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</p>
      <p>With only two groups you get a single Tukey comparison - not really
        necessary unless you have three or more groups, but you can see the
        method works.</p>
      <p>Similarly, if we don't have a food x time interaction we can test for
        sequential differences without having to consider the food groupings -
        to test each of the sequential differences against 0 use (in the
        Console):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">sapply(apply(diffs, MARGIN = 2, FUN = t.test), FUN =
        function(x) x$p.value)</p>
      <p>The apply() function does the paired t-tests for each column in diffs,
        like we did above, but this time we aren't splitting by food group. The
        sapply() collects the p-values and displays them. We can get the
        p-values in a nice table by wrapping this command inside a data.frame()
        command, with the output labeled p, like so (in the Console):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(p = sapply(apply(diffs, MARGIN = 2, FUN =
        t.test), FUN = function(x) x$p.value))</p>
      <p>You should get a nice column of p-values, with the days that are being
        differenced shown in the row labels.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Other questions: when do they return to pre-feeding weight?</h3>
    <p>What if we were interested in when the animals returned to pre-feeding
      weight? Since we're working with ratios of weights to their pre-feeding
      weights this is a question of differences from 1.</p>
    <p>We can split the weights by food type (chunk split.weight.by.food):</p>
    <p class="rmd">split(weights[days], weights$food) -&gt; weights.split</p>
    <p> calculate the differences from 1 with (chunk
      weights.return.to.prefeeding):</p>
    <p class="rmd">sapply(weights.split, FUN = function(x) apply(x, MARGIN = 2,
      FUN = function(y) t.test(y, mu = 1)$p.value))</p>
    <p>This command is another nested set of applies - the outer one feeds the
      list with weights for each food group into the inner apply() function,
      which then takes care of conducting one-sample t-tests of each set of
      weights. The t-tests use the value of 1 as the null hypothetical value (mu
      = 1), and we extract the p-values from each test (the $p.value attached to
      the t.test() function does this). </p>
    <p>There are 16 different p-values produced, so consider the p-values to be
      significant if they are less than an alpha level of 0.05/16 = 0.003125.
      You'll see that at this level the arginine group returns to pre-feeding
      weight by the last day, but the blood-fed animals do not.</p>
