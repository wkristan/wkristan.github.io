      <h2 class="part" id="numerical_analysis">Numerical analysis</h2>
      <p>Numerical analysis is a general term for methods that yield approximate solutions to problems, instead of
        analytical ones. Analytical solutions come from developing equations to describe a system, and then solving for
        some quantity of interest. Analytical solutions are mathematically correct, which means they have an infinite
        precision - you can calculate analytical solutions to as many decimal places as you need, and the answer will be
        accurate.</p>
      <p>In contrast, numerical methods are sophisticated versions of trial and error. Numerical solutions have a fixed
        level of precision, meaning that they are only expected to be accurate to a specified number of decimal places.
        We get to specify the precision, up to a point - remember, in Excel we get 15 significant digits to play with.
        In the majority of cases you would encounter, a solution that is accurate to 15 significant digits is more than
        accurate enough. If you only require a solution to a few significant digits anyway, numerical solutions can be
        found that are identical to analytical ones to that level, either approach will work equally well. For some
        equations analytical solutions don't exist, in which case numerical methods are the only option.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We actually have two goals for today.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Learn to use numerical analysis to find solutions to problems. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Learn how to translate equations expressed in mathematical notation into cell formulas in Excel.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second goal will emerge from working on the first. As you work through the problems, I will start by giving
        you examples of how to do the translation, and then will give you only advice about how to make the translation,
        and will end by only giving you the mathematical notation and telling you to do the translation yourself. Don't
        hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck, but do try it yourself each time first.<br>

      <h2 class="part" id="data">Jack and hooknose male salmon</h2>
      <img src="jack_hooknose.jpg" alt="Male salmon" style="width: 360px; height: 167px;" vspace="2" hspace="5" align="left">
      <p>Chinook salmon are a species of Pacific salmon that hatched in freshwater streams, move out to the ocean to
        develop into adults, and then return to their natal streams to spawn. Chinook males are found in two different
        morphs, "jacks" and "hooknoses". Hooknoses are the large males with the curved upper jaw that you probably think
        of when you picture a salmon. Jacks are small males that more closely resemble females in size and color, and
        lack the curved upper jaw. The picture to the left shows the two different kinds of males - the jacks are very
        different.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> For a long time jacks were thought to be "runts" that didn't reproduce. Further study has shown, however, that
        jacks come from the largest juveniles that reach sexual maturity early, and return to spawn a year or more
        younger than the hooknoses, but at a smaller body size. Rather than being runts, they are sexually precocious.
        Female salmon lay unfertilized eggs into depressions in the gravel at the bottom of a stream (called "redds"),
        which are then fertilized externally by a male. The large, hooknosed males defend females at redds, and chase
        away rival males. Jacks are not able to defend females against the larger, older hooknose males by fighting, but
        they can instead use their small body size as an advantage. Jack salmon will hide in proximity to a female and
        her intended hooknose male mate, and then rush in and fertilize the eggs while the hooknose male is busy
        defending against other big males in the area.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The success of the jack and hooknose male reproductive strategies depends on how common each is in the
        population. When there are few jacks in the population, the hooknose males are constantly distracted by
        challenges from other hooknose males, and since the jacks are more easily overlooked they have much higher
        success in sneaking in and fertilizing eggs. When jacks are very common, and thus the hooknose males are
        relatively less common, the hooknose males can focus on defending against jacks, and can fertilize the eggs as
        soon as they are laid by the females; jacks end up fertilizing very few eggs when there are too many jacks
        around. </p>
      <p>This system is an example of "frequency dependent" selection, because the success of each reproductive strategy
        depends on the frequency of each type of male in the population. Frequency dependent selection tends to lead to
        a "stable polymorophism", meaning that more than one morphology is found in the population; because both male
        morphologies become highly successful when they are rare, they are protected from being eliminated from the
        population.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="prop_jacks">Expected proportion of jack males in the population</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <table style="width: 100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img alt="Equilibrium" src="equilibrium.jpg" hspace="5" align="left">We will use what is already known
                from studies of breeding success in jacks and hooknose males to estimate the proportion of jacks we
                would expect to find in a population, given the reproductive fitness of each type of male at a
                particular proportion of jacks in the population. Fitness here refers to Darwinian fitness, which is a
                measure of an individual's genetic representation in the next generation. Fitness includes both survival
                and reproduction, but we can use reproduction as an index of fitness (all of the salmon die after
                spawning, so neither has a long-term survival advantage in any event).</p>
              <p>According to this graph, both strategies depend on the percent jacks in the population. As you move
                along the x-axis, you'll see that at nearly every point one strategy is better than the other. When the
                percent jacks is low, the jack strategy is better, and jacks will have higher fitness. Higher fitness
                implies that more of the offspring produced will be jacks, and in the next generation the percent jacks
                will be higher. Eventually the percent jacks will get large enough that the hooknose strategy starts to
                have higher fitness, and hooknoses will start to increase in frequency. The only place where neither
                strategy has an advantage is at p*, because the fitnesses are the same there - p* is thus the
                equilibrium percent jacks, which is the point where no change in percent jacks is expected. Populations
                should generally approach this equilibrium. Since the equilibrium isn't at 0 or 100%, we expect that
                there will always be a mix of the two male strategies in populations - thus, a stable polymorphism.</p>

      </table>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Let's see how we can use numerical analysis to estimate this equilibrium point.<br>
      </p>
      <p><input value="step1value" name="step1" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 1. Download data. </strong></p>
      <p>Download <a href="jack_salmon_demog.xlsx">this</a> file and open it. The first worksheet (called "Prop jacks
        graphs") has three columns, one labeled "Proportion jacks", one "Jack fitness", and one "Hooknose fitness".
        Proportions of males that are jacks from 0 to 1 are given (which is the range of all possible values - we can't
        have negative proportions, or proportions greater than 1). Fitness will be represented by the number of
        offspring per male on average.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><input value="step2value" name="step2" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 2. Calculate the fitnesses of jacks and
          hooknoses.</strong></p>
      <p>From studies of breeding success for these different male morphs, the following equations predict the fitness
        of each morph:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Jack males: fitness = 3.5 e <sup>-3 (prop. jacks)</sup></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Hooknose males: fitness = 0.5 e <sup>2 (prop. jacks)</sup></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To do the calculations you will need to translate these equations into Excel formulas - I'll give you the first
        one for jack male fitness, which you'll enter into cell B2:</p>
      <p><span class="Excel">=3.5*exp(-3*a2)</span></p>
      <p>Copy and paste it to the rest of the Proportion jacks (through cell b12). </p>
      <p>Now you can translate the equation for hooknose males and enter it into C2, and copy/paste to the rest of the
        hooknose male cells (if you enter it correctly you'll get 0.5 as the value in cell C2).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step3value" name="step3" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 3. Plot jack fitness and hooknose male
          fitness against proportion jacks. </strong></p>
      <p> <input value="step3a.value" name="step3a" type="checkbox">Select the three columns, and insert a scatter plot
        showing only smooth lines (no symbols). If your equations were entered correctly, your graph should look like <a
          class="link" style="display: none" href="graph1_fitness.jpeg">this</a> <span class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img
              src="graph1_fitness.jpeg"></span></span> </p>
      <p>(this is the default graph, without changing the x-axis scaling, and without adding axis labels - not okay for
        a final product). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step3b.value" name="step3b" type="checkbox">Once you have your graph, find the place(s) where
        the lines cross. In cell B14 enter how many times the lines cross - this will tell us how many equilibrium
        solutions we need to find. </p>
      <p><input name="step3c" type="checkbox">In B15 enter the approximate equilibrium proportion jacks you expect based
        on your interpretation of the graph - in other words, at about what x-axis value does the line crossing occur?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step4value" name="step4" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 4. Set up conditions for the Solver to
          solve. </strong></p>
      <p>Switch to the worksheet called "Prop jacks equil", and you will see labels for "Proportion of jacks" (B3),
        "Fitness of jacks" (B5), "Fitness of hooknoses" (B7), "Difference in fitness" (B9), and "Analytical solution"
        (B12). To set up the worksheet to find the equilibrium proportion of jacks do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell C3, enter the proportion of jacks you expect will be the equilibrium, which you entered in cell B15
          of sheet 1. This will be your starting value for Solver to work with, which will work best if it's an educated
          guess</li>
        <li>In cell C5 enter the expected fitness of jacks, given this beginning proportion of jacks. This is the same
          formula you entered in the previous sheet for fitness of jacks, but you will use C3 from this sheet as the
          proportion of jacks (so, you can copy and paste the formula from the "Prop jacks graphs" sheet, but then
          change the cell reference to point to c3 instead of a2 in your exp() function).</li>
        <li>In cell C7 enter the fitness of hooknoses, given this beginning proportion of jacks. Use the formula you
          entered in the "Prop jacks graphs" sheet, but use C3 as the proportion jacks.</li>
        <li>In the "Difference in fitness" cell, cell C9, calculate the difference between the fitnesses. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since fitnesses are always non-negative, we can simply take the difference here - the difference will only be
        zero when the fitnesses are equal, and when it's zero we've found the equilibrium proportion of jacks expected
        in the population.</p>
      <p>Now everything is set, we just need to use Solver to find the equilibrium proportion of jacks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step5value" name="step5" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 5. Use the Solver to calculate the
          equilibrium proportion of jacks. </strong></p>
      <p>The Solver is found at the right side of the ribbon in the Data tab, but it may not be turned on yet. </p>
      <p>If you don't see a Solver option, do the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Select "File", and find the "Options" at the bottom of the green field on the left side of the window. </li>
        <li> At the bottom of the "Excel Options" window will be a selection called "Add-Ins", which you should select.
        </li>
        <li> At the bottom of the "Add-ins" window is the "Manage" "Excel Add-ins" area - click the "Go" button. </li>
        <li> Finally, check the box next to "Solver Add-in" and click "OK". </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now when you switch to "Data" you should see the solver option at the right side of the ribbon. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><input name="Step5.c2" type="checkbox">Start the Solver. There are several things we need to do here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Give Solver an objective. To do this, enter $C$9 into the "Set Target Cell" box - the objective is the
            difference in fitnesses between the strategies that we want to be zero. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Click on the "Value of" button for the "To:" option and enter 0 as the value - in other words, we're
            telling Solver we want the differences to be 0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tell solver what cells to change in order to meet the objective. Enter $C$3 into the "By Changing Variable
            Cells" box - this will alter the proportion of jacks. Excel will change this cell until the difference is 0
            (or, more correctly, until it is as close to 0 as we've asked it to get).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tell solver what numbers it's allowed to use when it changes the variable cells. We know that the
            proportion jacks can't be lower than 0 or greater than 1, but Solver has no way to know this. We can tell
            solver to only try out proportion jack values to numbers between 0 and 1 by setting constraints. Click on
            "Add" next to the "Subject to the constraints" area. Set the cell reference to C3 and use &lt;= 1 as the
            constraint (click "OK" to apply the constraint). Repeat this operation to add the constraint that cell C3
            must be &gt;= 0. Both constraints should now be in the Subject to the Constraints list.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> When you're done with the setup, your solver parameters should look like <span class="popup">this<img class="popupimage"
            src="solver.jpeg"></span>. Click on "Solve". </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Note that the difference in fitness is not exactly equal to 0. This is a numerical solution, and Solver quits
        when it gets sufficiently close to its objective (how close can be set by you with the "Precision" and
        "Convergence" options, but the default is usually adequate).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step6value" name="step6" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 6. Confirm this is the correct answer by
          changing the starting values, and by calculating the analytical solution<br>
        </strong></p>
      <p>Since this is a numerical method, there's a chance that the solution isn't the right one. You can guard against
        this possibility by comparing the proportion of jacks that Solver produced against the graph to see if it at
        least looks like the right value. The proportion jacks you should have gotten (0.38918) is in fact about where
        the two lines cross on the graph.</p>
      <p>Another way to double-check the result is to change the proportion of jacks to 0 and run the Solver again.
        Then, change the proportion of jacks to 1 and run it again. You'll see that the difference in fitness cell is
        not identical in each run, which means the proportion of jacks isn't identical either. But, the solution should
        be the same to at least five decimal places, regardless of the starting point, which will be more than precise
        enough for our purposes. If we were going to use this number to test experimental data, we would be comparing
        proportions of jacks in populations from the wild, and with all the variation that goes along with field studies
        we would be satisfied with a predicted value that is accurate to the 1% level, and our estimates are much better
        than that.</p>
      <p>Finally, this is a case in which we could have used an analytical solution. If we set the two equations equal
        to one another and solve for p, the equilibrium value of p would be:</p>
      <p class="Excel">=(ln(3.5)-ln(0.5))/5</p>
      <p>Type this into C12, next to the label "Analytical solution" - it should match your Solver solution to several
        decimal places, which shows you that numerical methods are viable alternatives to analytical approaches.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="lifetable">Finding population growth rate from a life table</h2>
      <p>Now that we've confirmed that Solver can find solutions that are match the analytical solution we will switch
        to an example that has no analytical solution. As you learned in lecture, we can calculate a population growth
        rate from a life table using the Euler equation, which is Î£l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>. The value
        we want to calculate is r, and it isn't possible to solve for r. We will use Solver to estimate r numerically.</p>
      <p>On the sheet "Life table", you have data on Chinook salmon survival and reproduction. The first column,
        "Stage", gives a name to each row of the table - the first row represents eggs laid, and the second row
        represents juvenile salmon that migrate to sea. The rest of the rows are the numbers of individuals that are
        adults for one year, two years, three years, and so on. The age (in years) that corresponds with each stage is
        in column B, and the number of individuals of each age is in C, labeled n(x). The numbers are standardized to
        start at 100,000 eggs laid, and you can see that for 100,000 eggs only 4800 juveniles will survive, only 336
        will make it to their first year of adulthood, and only 57 live to be ten years old. The next column (D, labeled
        b(x)) is births per spawning adults.</p>
      <p>To calculate population growth rate, we will need a column for survivorship (lx), the product of survivorship
        and birth rate (lxbx), and then the Euler equation calculation for each row (l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>).
        We will use a cell in the spreadsheet (G13) to specify the growth rate (r) in the Euler equation. We will then
        sum the Euler column. With this setup, any time we change the value of r in cell G13 we will change the sum of
        the Euler values. By telling Solver to change the growth rate in G13 until the Euler sum in G15 is equal to 1,
        we can estimate the growth rate.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem1" type="checkbox">Step 1. Calculate lx</strong></p>
      <p>lx is the proportion of the total number originally in the population that is still alive at age x. In cell e2
        type:</p>
      <p class="Excel">=c2/c$2</p>
      <p>Copy and paste this to the rest of the cells in column E. Using an absolute reference to the second row for the
        denominator means that every value in the n(x) column is divided by the original number of salmon in value C2.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem2" type="checkbox">Step 2. Calculate lxbx</strong></p>
      <p>This is just the product of the lx and the bx column. For each cell, multiply the lx by the bx value in the
        same row. You can do this, make it so!</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem3" type="checkbox">Step 3. Calculate the Euler value</strong></p>
      <p>Enter a starting value for r of 0 into cell G13.</p>
      <p>Translate the Euler formula, (l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>), into an Excel spreadsheet formula in
        cell G2, then copy and paste to the rest of the cells. Use G$13 as the value of r, and use the ages in column B
        for the value of x inside of your exp() function. Don't forget the minus sign on -rx.</p>
      <p>Then, sum the values in G2 through G11 in cell G15.</p>
      <p>If all went well, the sheet should look like <span class="popup">this<img class="popupimage" src="life_table.jpg"></span>.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem4" type="checkbox">Step 4. Use Solver to find r.</strong></p>
      <p>Now, use Solver to find the growth rate for this population. To do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start Solver</li>
        <li>Use G15 as the objective</li>
        <li>Have Solver set the objective to 1 </li>
        <li>Change the growth rate in G13</li>
        <li>Growth rates can be negative, so un-check the box that says "Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let Solver find a solution. You should see that it's a negative value (-0.09695), which is probably correct -
        most species of Pacific salmon are declining.</p>
      <p> <strong><input name="dem4" type="checkbox">Step 5. Check for other possible solutions.</strong></p>
      <p>We can use our array formula skills for this step. We want to confirm that there is only one value of r that
        results in an Euler sum of 1, so let's start by making a range of r values in column i:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter "r" in i1</li>
        <li>Enter the value -1 in i2</li>
        <li>Enter the value -0.9 in i3</li>
        <li>Select i2 and i3 and use the fill handle to extend the series to cell i22 - the value in i22 should be 1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next enter the formula to calculate the Euler sum for r of -1:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter "Sum Euler" in J1</li>
        <li>Enter the formula =sum(d$2:d$11*e$2:e$11*exp(-i2*b$2:b$11)) in cell J2 and use CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to record it
          as an array formula - this does the same calculation we did in cell G15, but this time using the growth rate
          in i2</li>
        <li>Copy the cell and paste it to the rest of the cells below, J3 through J22</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll see that the sum gets close to 1 at a growth rate of -0.1, which is close to the estimate in G13 of
        -0.09695. Below -0.1 the sums become huge, and above -0.1 they approach zero, so there is no reason to expect
        there to be more than one value that sets the Euler sum to 1 - our estimate of -0.09695 is the only solution we
        need to find.</p>
      <h3>Improving birth rate to stabilize the population</h3>
      <p>We can use numerical analysis to answer hypothetical questions as well - for example, this population is
        evidently in deep trouble, and if we wanted to do something about it we would need to improve survival or
        reproductive success, or both. We can use Solver to help us determine how much of an improvement in these
        demographic rates we would need to stabilize the population.</p>
      <p>We'll start with improvements needed to reproduction.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1: make a copy of the worksheet</strong></p>
      <p>We don't want to alter the actual table, so let's make a copy we can mess around with.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right-click on the "Life table" tab, and select "Move or copy"</li>
        <li>Check the "Create a copy" box, and select [move to end]</li>
        <li>Click "OK"</li>
        <li>Double-click on the new tab and change the name to "Reproduction"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Step 2: Move the b(x) column</strong></p>
      <p>We'll move the b(x) column down to the cells below it so that we can use them as the basis for altering the
        values in the table.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select cells D2 through D11</li>
        <li>Copy</li>
        <li>Paste to cell D14 (select D14 and paste - the entire set of b(x) values will be pasted in D14 through D23)</li>
        <li>Enter the label "Original b(x)" in cell D13</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Step 3: Enter a multiplier that represents the amount of improvement needed</strong></p>
      <p>In cell D25 enter the value 1, and in C25 enter the label "Improvement needed"</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4: make the b(x) values equal to the original b(x) values multiplied by the improvement needed</strong></p>
      <p>In cell D2 enter a formula that multiplies D14 by D25 - use an absolute reference for the row in D25, and
        copy/paste the formula to the rest of the b(x) cells in D3 through D11.</p>
      <p>To confirm this all worked, you should initially see the same b(x) values as before, because you're multiplying
        them all by 1. Set the improvement needed to 2 and you should get all the b(x) values in the table doubled.</p>
      <p>Set the improvement needed back to 1 for the next step.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 5: use Solver to find the amount of improvement needed to stabilize the population</strong></p>
      <p>Now we're going to find the amount of improvement in birth rates needed to stabilize the population. A stable
        population has a growth rate of 0, so enter 0 into cell G13.</p>
      <p>Start Solver, and this time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the sum Euler cell (G15) as the objective again, and have Solver set it to 1</li>
        <li>Change the Improvement needed in cell D25</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll see that the improvement needed is 1.775221 - this means that we need to increase reproduction by 77.5%
        to stabilize the population.</p>
      <h3>Improving survival to stabilize the population</h3>
      <p>Make another copy of the Life table sheet, move it to the end of the workbook, and re-name it "Survival".</p>
      <p>Copy and paste the as values the lx values in cells E2 through E11 - paste their values into cells C14 through
        C23, and label them in C13 "Original lx"</p>
      <p>Enter the improvement needed in C25, and label it as "Improvement needed" in cell B25.</p>
      <p>Start with the lx for the migrants - in cell E3 multiply the lx for migrants in cell c15 by the improvement
        needed in cell c25 (use an absolute cell reference for the rows of c25). Why not start with the eggs? Because
        the life table sets lx to 1 for eggs, and we can't do better than 100% survival.</p>
      <p>Set growth rate to 0, and then use Solver to find the improvement needed to get the Euler sum back to 1.</p>
      <p>You'll see that it would also take a 77.5% improvement in survival to stabilize the population.</p>
