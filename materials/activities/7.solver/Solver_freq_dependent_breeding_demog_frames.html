      <h2 class="part" id="numerical_analysis">Numerical analysis</h2>
      <p>Numerical analysis is a general term that refers to methods that yield
        approximate solutions to problems, instead of analytical ones.
        Analytical solutions come from developing equations to describe a
        system, and then solving for some quantity of interest. Analytical
        solutions are mathematically correct, which means they have an infinite
        precision - you can calculate analytical solutions to as many decimal
        places as you need, and the answer will be accurate.</p>
      <p>In contrast, numerical methods are sophisticated versions of trial and
        error. Numerical solutions have a fixed level of precision, meaning that
        they are only expected to be accurate to a specified number of decimal
        places. We get to specify the precision, up to a point - remember, in
        Excel we get 15 significant digits to play with. In the majority of
        cases you would encounter, a solution that is accurate to 15 significant
        digits is more than accurate enough. If you only require a solution to a
        few significant digits anyway, numerical solutions can be found that are
        identical to analytical ones to that level, either approach will work
        equally well. For some equations analytical solutions don't exist, in
        which case numerical methods are the only option.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We actually have two goals for today.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Learn to use numerical analysis to find solutions to problems. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Learn how to translate equations expressed in mathematical notation
            into cell formulas in Excel.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second goal will emerge from working on the first. As you work
        through the problems, I will start by giving you examples of how to do
        the translation, and then will give you only advice about how to make
        the translation, and will end by only giving you the mathematical
        notation and telling you to do the translation yourself. Don't hesitate
        to ask for help if you get stuck, but do try it yourself each time
        first.<br>

      <h2 class="part" id="data">Jack and hooknose male salmon</h2>
      <img src="jack_hooknose.jpg" alt="Male salmon" style="width: 360px; height: 167px;"
        vspace="2" align="left" hspace="5">
      <p>Chinook salmon are a species of Pacific salmon that hatched in
        freshwater streams, move out to the ocean to develop into adults, and
        then return to their natal streams to spawn. Chinook males are found in
        two different morphs, "jacks" and "hooknoses". Hooknoses are the large,
        hooknose males with the curved upper jaw that you probably think of when
        you picture a salmon. Jacks are small males that more closely resemble
        females in size and color, and lack the curved upper jaw. The picture to
        the left shows the two different kinds of males - the jacks are very
        different.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> For a long time jacks were thought to be "runts" that didn't
        reproduce. Further study has shown, however, that jacks come from the
        largest juveniles that reach sexual maturity early, and return to spawn
        a year or more younger than the hooknoses, but at a smaller body size.
        Rather than being runts, they are sexually precocious. Female salmon lay
        unfertilized eggs into depressions in the gravel at the bottom of a
        stream (called "redds"), which are then fertilized externally by a male.
        The large, hooknosed males defend females at redds, and chase away rival
        males. Jacks are not able to defend females against the larger, older
        hooknose males by fighting, but they can instead use their small body
        size as an advantage. Jack salmon will hide in proximity to a female and
        her intended hooknose male mate, and then rush in and fertilize the eggs
        while the hooknose male is busy defending against other big males in the
        area.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The success of the jack and hooknose male reproductive strategies
        depends on how common each is in the population. When there are few
        jacks in the population, the hooknose males are constantly distracted by
        challenges from other hooknose males, and since the jacks are more
        easily overlooked they have much higher success in sneaking in and
        fertilizing eggs. When jacks are very common, and thus the hooknose
        males are relatively less common, the hooknose males can focus on
        defending against jacks, and can fertilize the eggs as soon as they are
        laid by the females; jacks end up fertilizing very few eggs when there
        are too many jacks around. </p>
      <p>This system is an example of "frequency dependent" selection, because
        the success of each reproductive strategy depends on the frequency of
        each type of male in the population. Frequency dependent selection tends
        to lead to a "stable polymorophism", meaning that more than one
        morphology is found in the population; because both male morphologies
        become highly successful when they are rare, they are protected from
        being eliminated from the population.</p>

              <p><img alt="Equilibrium" src="equilibrium.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">We
                will use what is already known from studies of breeding success
                in jacks and hooknose males to estimate the proportion of jacks
                we would expect to find in a population, given the reproductive
                fitness of each type of male at a particular proportion of jacks
                in the population. Fitness here refers to Darwinian fitness,
                which is a measure of an individual's genetic representation in
                the next generation. Fitness includes both survival and
                reproduction, but we can use reproduction as an index of fitness
                (all of the salmon die after spawning, so neither has a
                long-term survival advantage in any event).</p>
              <p>According to this graph, both strategies depend on the percent
                jacks in the population. As you move along the x-axis, you'll
                see that at nearly every point one strategy is better than the
                other. When the percent jacks is low, the jack strategy is
                better, and jacks will have higher fitness. Higher fitness
                implies that more of the offspring produced will be jacks, and
                in the next generation the percent jacks will be higher.
                Eventually the percent jacks will get large enough that the
                hooknose strategy starts to have higher fitness, and hooknoses
                will start to increase in frequency. The only place where
                neither strategy has an advantage is at p*, because the
                fitnesses are the same there - p* is thus the equilibrium
                percent jacks, which is the point where no change in percent
                jacks is expected. Populations should generally approach this
                equilibrium. Since the equilibrium isn't at 0 or 100%, we expect
                that there will always be a mix of the two male strategies in
                populations - thus, a stable polymorphism.</p>

        The first worksheet (called "Prop jacks graphs") has three columns, one
        labeled "Proportion jacks", one "Jack fitness", and one "Hooknose
        fitness". Proportions of males that are jacks from 0 to 1 are given
        (which is the range of all possible values - we can't have negative
        proportions, or proportions greater than 1). Fitness will be represented
        by the number of offspring per male on average.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><input value="step2value" name="step2" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 2.
          Calculate the fitnesses of jacks and hooknoses.</strong></p>
      <p>From studies of breeding success for these different male morphs, the
        following equations predict the fitness of each morph:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Jack males: fitness = 3.5 e <sup>-3 (prop. jacks)</sup></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Hooknose males: fitness = 0.5 e <sup>2 (prop. jacks)</sup></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In the "Jack fitness" and "Hooknose fitness" columns, use these
        equations to calculate the expected male fitnesses. To do the
        calculations you will need to translate them into Excel formulas. The
        value e<sup>x</sup> is calculated using the "exp()" function - for
        example, e<sup>2</sup> is exp(2).</p>
      <p>For example, for jack males the formula would be:</p>
      <p><span class="Excel">=3.5*exp(-3*a2)</span></p>
      <p>Enter this formula for jack fitness in cell b2, and then copy and paste
        it to the rest of the Proportion jacks (through cell b12). Now you can
        translate the equation for hooknose males and enter it into c2, and
        copy/paste to the rest of the hooknose male cells.</p>

        different morphs, the proportion hooknoses is just 1-(prop. jacks), so
        we do not have to estimate this value - if we're interested, we can
        easily calculate it from the estimate of the proportion of jacks at

      <p>In the "Difference in fitness" cell, cell C9, calculate the difference

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Select "File", and find the "Options" at the bottom of the green

        several things we need to do here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Give Solver an objective. To do this, enter $C$9 into the "Set
            Target Cell" box, which is the difference in fitnesses between the

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Click on the "Value of" button for the "To:" option and enter 0 as
            the value - in other words, we're telling Solver we want the
            differences to be 0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tell solver what cells to change in order to meet the objective.
            Enter $C$3 into the "By Changing Variable Cells" box - this will
            alter the proportion of jacks. Excel will change this cell until the
            difference is 0 (or, more correctly, until it is as close to 0 as
            we've asked it to get).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tell solver what numbers it's allowed to use when it changes the
            variable cells. We know that the proportion jacks can't be lower
            than 0 or greater than 1, but Solver has no way to know this. We can
            tell solver to only try out proportion jack values to numbers
            between 0 and 1 by setting constraints. Click on "Add" next to the
            "Subject to the constraints" area. Set the cell reference to C3 and
            use &lt;= 1 as the constraint (click "OK" to apply the constraint).
            Repeat this operation to add the constraint that cell C3 must be
            &gt;= 0. Both constraints should now be in the Subject to the
            Constraints list.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When you're done with the setup, your solver parameters should look like <a
        class="link" style="display:none" href="solver.jpeg">this</a><span class="ipt">this<span
          class="ip"><img src="solver.jpeg"></span></span>. Click on "Solve".
      <p> </p>
      <p> Note that the difference in fitness is not exactly equal to 0. This is
        a numerical solution, and Solver quits when it gets sufficiently close
        to its objective (how close can be set by you with the "Precision" and
        "Convergence" options, but the default is usually adequate).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input value="step6value" name="step6" type="checkbox"><strong>Step
          6. Confirm this is the correct answer by changing the starting values,
          and by calculating the analytical solution<br>
        </strong></p>
      <p>Since this is a numerical method, there's a chance that the solution
        isn't the right one. You can guard against this possibility by comparing
        the proportion of jacks that Solver produced against the graph to see if
        it at least looks like the right value. </p>
      <p>Another way to double-check the result is to change the proportion of
        jacks to 0 and run the Solver again. Then, change the proportion of
        jacks to 1 and run it again. You'll see that the difference in fitness
        cell is not identical in each run, which means the proportion of jacks
        isn't identical either. But, the solution should be the same to at least
        five decimal places, regardless of the starting point, which will be
        more than precise enough for our purposes. If we were going to use this
        number to test experimental data, we would be comparing proportions of
        jacks in populations from the wild, and with all the variation that goes
        along with field studies we would be satisfied with a predicted value
        that is accurate to the 1% level, and our estimates are much better than
        that.</p>
      <p>Finally, this is a case in which we could have used an analytical
        solution. If we set the two equations equal to one another and solve for
        p, the equilibrium value of p would be:</p>
      <p class="Excel">=(ln(3.5)-ln(0.5))/5</p>
      <p>Type this into C12, next to the label "Analytical solution" - it should
        match your Solver solution to several decimal places, which shows you
        that numerical methods are viable alternatives to analytical approaches.</p>

          vspace="2" align="left" hspace="2">The next question we will address
        is, what behaviors should male salmon exhibit, given their sizes? Larger
        males can't sneak very well, because they are seen and chased off by the
        male guarding the female. Jacks can't guard females very well, because
        large males will come and chase them off before they can breed. However,
        we know that all male salmon know how to either sneak or fight, because
        the behaviors are seen at low frequencies in males that are either too
        large or too small to use them effectively. Using the size-appropriate
        behavior is clearly beneficial. The really unlucky male is the one that
        is intermediate in size, because he will be too big to sneak and too
        small to fight well - the two behaviors will work equally, but both will
        be equally bad.</p>
      <p>Since fertilization is external researchers use the distance from the
        female as an indication of a male's chance to breed with her, with short
        distances being beneficial. If we know the distances to females achieved
        for each strategy (sneaking and fighting) across different male body
        sizes for jack males, we can estimate the size at which jacks should
        switch from primarily sneaking to primarily fighting.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Based on observations of males in the wild, the equations that
        characterize the distance from a female for jack males using either a
        sneaking or fighting strategy, as a function of his body size, are:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Sneaking: Distance = 100/(1+e<sup>-(-20+0.5*body size)</sup>)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Fighting: Distance = 100/(1+e<sup>-(24-0.6*body size)</sup>)</p>
      <p> </p>

      </p>
      <p>Switch to sheet "Behaviors graphs", and calculate the distances for

        Excel formulas. </p>
      <p>These formulas are a little more complex than the first set, so a
        couple of helpful hints for doing this translation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Watch the + and - signs. There is a minus before the exponents for
            both, but a minus sign before the intercept only for the sneaking
            behavior.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When in doubt, use parentheses. Some of the parentheses you need to
            use are in the formulas, but if you aren't sure the calculations are
            being done in the right order, or being applied to the right values,
            use parentheses to ensure the calculations are done correctly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Close every open parentheses. Excel will help you with this - as
            you type a right parentheses, ), Excel will color code and bold the
            left parentheses it closes.</p>

        (C9) as the target cell, and change the size in cell C3 until the target
        equals 0. We won't bother adding constraints here - although we could
        constrain the size to be greater than zero and less than the maximum
        size of a salmon. If we were to get a size that is negative or the size
        of an elephant we could re-run with constraints to avoid this. Run the
        solver, and copy the Size and paste-special the value into cell C12 (not
        the formula, just the value).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="Step2.5" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 5. Confirm that
          the starting value doesn't affect the final estimate. </strong></p>
      <p>Re-run Solver with a starting size of 25, and check that the size of
        switch is the same as before. Then re-run Solver with a starting size of
        75, and check that the size of switch is the same as before.</p>
      <p>Now, re-run it again with a starting size of 20, and you'll see that
        bad things happen - Solver chases a solution out into negative sizes,
        and then hits an error and stops. </p>
      <p>To understand why this happens, look at the graph on the "Behaviors
        graphs" sheet - you'll see that below a body size of about 30 cm and
        above about 80 cm the graphs get very flat, and in fact the functions
        we're using asymptote at 0 and 100. If you give Solver a starting body
        size of 20 cm, the graphs are not only flat at that point, they are flat
        for a pretty wide range of values around 20 cm. Since Solver is finding
        a solution by changing the size and seeing whether it gets closer to its
        objective of 0 difference, when the curves are this flat a change in
        size has almost no effect on the difference. This means that Solver
        doesn't see an improvement moving in either direction from 20 cm, so it
        starts looking further and further away from the starting point looking
        for an improvement. The exp() functions we're using are raising a base
        (e) to the power of a function of size, and as the size gets really big
        the exp() function exceeds its ability to calculate the resulting
        exponential (the #NUM! error you may have seen in cells C7 an C9 when
        Solver choked are due to these numerical errors in the exp() functions).</p>
      <p>What this show us is that it's important when you're using numerical
        methods to start as close to the final solutions as possible. Graphing
        the functions is a good idea both because it helps you understand what
        you're doing, and because it gives you a ballpark idea of what the final
        solution should be so you don't run into these problems.</p>
      <p>You can set the distance back to 40 before you move to the next step.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="Step2.6" type="checkbox"><strong>Step 6. Calculate the
          size at which sneaking produces a distance from females of 1 cm. </strong></p>
      <p>Now that we have the spreadsheet set up, we can use it to ask a
        different question about the same set of equations. Since salmon have
        external fertilization, being within 1 cm of a female could be used as a
        measure of getting close enough to breed. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> To do this, all we have to do is to use cell C5 as the target cell,
        and have Solver set it to a value of 1 by changing the size in cell C3.

      <p>Have Solver find this size, and copy and paste the answer to cell C14
        (since cell C5 is a formula, you will need to use "Paste special" and

      <h2 class="part" id="lifetable">Finding population growth rate from a life
        table</h2>
      <p>We'll finish up with an example of a problem for which there is no
        analytical solution. As you learned in lecture, we can calculate a
        population growth rate from a life table using the Euler equation, which
        is Î£l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>. The value we want to
        calculate is r, and it isn't possible to solve for r. We will use Solver
        to estimate r numerically.</p>
      <p>On the sheet "Life table", you have data on Chinook salmon survival and
        reproduction. The first column, "Stage", gives a name to each row of the
        table - the first row represents eggs laid, and the second row
        represents juvenile salmon that migrate to sea. The rest of the rows are
        the numbers of individuals that are adults for one year, two years,
        three years, and so on. The age (in years) that corresponds with each
        stage is in column B, and the number of individuals of each age is in C,
        labeled n(x). The numbers are standardized to start at 100,000 eggs
        laid, and you can see that for 100,000 eggs only 4800 juveniles will
        survive, only 336 will make it to their first year of adulthood, and
        only 57 live to be ten years old. The next column (D, labeled b(x)) is
        births per spawning adults. I put this table together assuming that all
        of the spawners had equal reproductive rates, but since most individuals
        don't spawn at one year the numbers are lowest for this adult age class.
        The highest reproductive rates per spawner are for five year and eight
        year adults, which is a reflection of the number of individuals that
        spawn at those ages rather than an actual difference in reproductive
        rate per individual.</p>
      <p>To calculate growth rate, we will need a column for survivorship (lx),
        the product of survivorship and birth rate (lxbx), and then the Euler
        equation calculation for each row (l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>).
        We will use a cell in the spreadsheet (G13) to specify the growth rate
        (r) in the Euler equation. We will then sum the Euler column. With this
        setup, any time we change the value of r in cell G13 we will change the
        sum of the Euler values. By telling Solver to change the growth rate in
        G13 until the Euler sum in G15 is equal to 1, we can estimate the growth
        rate.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem1" type="checkbox">Step 1. Calculate lx</strong></p>
      <p>lx is the proportion of the total number originally in the population
        that is still alive at age x. In cell e2 type:</p>
      <p class="Excel">=c2/c$2</p>
      <p>Copy and paste this to the rest of the cells in column E.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem2" type="checkbox">Step 2. Calculate lxbx</strong></p>
      <p>This is just the product of the lx and the bx column. For each cell,
        multiply the lx by the bx value in the same row.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem3" type="checkbox">Step 3. Calculate the Euler
          value</strong></p>
      <p>Enter a starting value for r of 0 into cell G13.</p>
      <p>Translate the Euler formula, (l<sub>x</sub>b<sub>x</sub>e<sup>-rx</sup>),
        into an Excel spreadsheet formula in cell G2, then copy and paste to the
        rest of the cells. Use G$13 as the value of r, and use the ages in
        column B for the value of x inside of your exp() function. Don't forget
        the minus sign on -rx.</p>
      <p>Then, sum the values in G2 through G11 in cell G15.</p>
      <p>If all went well, the sheet should look like <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="life_table.jpg">this</a> <span class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img
              src="life_table.jpg"></span></span>.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="dem4" type="checkbox">Step 4. Use Solver to find
          r.</strong></p>
      <p>Now, use Solver to set the Sum Euler value in G15 to 1, by changing the
        growth rate in G13. Be sure to un-check the box that says "Make
        Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative" - if we left this checked then
        Solver would assume that growth rate is positive, which may not be true.</p>
      <p>Let Solver find a solution. You should see that it's a negative value,
        which is probably correct - most species of Pacific salmon are
        declining.</p>
