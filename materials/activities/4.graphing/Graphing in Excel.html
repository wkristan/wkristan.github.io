      <h2 class="part" id="graphing">Graphing in Excel</h2>
      <p> If you recall from lecture, there are two major reasons to graph data:
        1) to better understand the data, as the analyst, and 2) to produce a
        clear presentation of the data to others. Today we will work with graphs
        that serve one or the other purposes (or in some cases both). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The data set we will use contains measurements of sizes and shapes of
        bears captured over time. At each capture, bears were identified by a
        unique ID number that was written on an ear tag placed on each bear, and
        the month of capture was recorded. The age and sex of the animal were
        recorded, as well as measurements of the head length and width, neck
        girth, chest girth, and total length of the animal. Since animals were
        often captured repeatedly, observation number was recorded to indicate
        the first, second, third, etc. capture. Animals were given names in
        addition to their unique ID numbers to make it easier to refer to
        individual bears.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Today we will make graphs that will help us address the following
        questions:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 1. What are the weights of males and females?</p>
      <p> 2. What is the nature of the relationship between weight (a volumetric
        variable) and various measured lengths (linear variables)?</p>
      <p> 3. Is there a difference in the length/weight relationship between
        males and females?</p>
      <p> 4. How does body weight vary from month to month for each sex?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The first, third, and fourth questions will be addressed with graphs
        that both help us understand the data ourselves, and are appropriate
        ways of presenting the data to others. The second question will be
        addressed by producing plots with different types of axis scaling, so
        that we can determine whether the relationship between weight and length
        measurements is linear, exponential, or a power function.</p>

      <p>The first step in graphing data is to think about what the variables
        are, and what kinds of graphs might be useful for them. The variable
        definitions and variable types are given here:</p>

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Knowing the variable types allows us to pick appropriate graph types.
        Be aware that the variable type is sometimes different than it appears
        to be - Month, ID, and Observation Number are all represented as
        numbers, but we will be using them as though they were ordinal
        categories. Month could potentially be used as a numeric variable as
        well - we might want to average the month numbers to find out the
        average month of the observations. Numeric months repeat between
        December and January, so Month is a circular variable, but since the
        period the bears were active starts in April and ends in November we
        don't need to worry about that with this data set.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that variables sometimes are coded with numbers when they
        are really categorical variables. For example, Sex might be coded as 1
        for male and 2 for female, but that doesn't mean the variable becomes
        numeric - it means that the numeric codes should be treated as
        categories.</p>
      <h2>Organizing the data for plotting<br>
      </h2>
      <p>Programs that are written to primarily be graphing packages would be
        less fussy than Excel is about data organization. For example, when we
        build a graph we would be able to assign any column we want to the
        x-axis and the y-axis, and would be able to group by a categorical
        variable for assigning colors and symbols. </p>
      <p>Excel doesn't give us these conveniences. We will be producing several
        scatter plots with these data, in which the weight of the bears is the
        x-axis. Excel will use the left-most column as x.</p>
      <p>So, to save us some hassles later, we should move Weight to the left of
        all the length columns we will be using so that Weight will
        automatically be assigned to the x-axis of our graphs.</p>
      <p>To move Weight, click on the J in the gray column letters to select the
        entire Weight column. Right-click and select "Cut". Then, select all of
        column E by clicking on the E. Right-click and select "Insert cut
        cells". This will move Weight to the left of all the lengths.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 id="wt_by_sex" class="part">1. What are the weights of males and
        females?</h2>
      <p>To address this question, produce a column chart of weights for each
        sex. The easiest way to do this is to first produce a pivot table with
        the needed data, then use the "PivotChart" to graph the data.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb2" type="checkbox">A. Select a cell within the data
        set (A2 would be good), and start a Pivot Table (click on the "Insert"
        tab, and insert a pivot table).</p>
      <p> <input name="cb3" type="checkbox">B. Calculate mean weights for each
        species. Use "sex" as the row labels, and "weight" as the data variable.
        Make sure to change the calculated value from "Sum" to "Average". The
        table should look like <a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_table_weight_by_sex.jpeg">this</a>
        <span class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table_weight_by_sex.jpeg"></span></span>.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb4" type="checkbox">C. With a cell of the pivot table
        selected. click on the "Analyze" tab under the "PIVOTTABLE TOOLS", and
        select "<a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_chart_select.jpeg">PivotChart</a><span
          class="ipt">PivotChart<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_chart_select.jpeg"></span></span>
        ".</p>
      <p> <input name="cb5" type="checkbox">D. From the "Insert Chart" chart
        type selector, choose the "Column Chart" type (the first option for the
        row). A chart will be placed in the worksheet. PivotCharts are designed
        for exploring your data, rather than for final presentation. PivotCharts
        are linked to the Pivot Table, and as you change the table the chart
        will change to reflect its new contents. The gray button that says
        "Average of Weight" gives the variable you are graphing, and the "Sex"
        drop down allows you to filter and sort the levels of sex.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb6" type="checkbox">E. Change the labeling. Although
        the basic chart is fine, there is a poor choice for a title, no axis
        labels, and a legend that is unneeded. Double-click on the title and
        change it to "Average weights of bears".</p>
      <p>Select the chart and you will see a black + and a paintbrush tool
        outside the right side of the graph. Click on the + and next to the
        "Axis Titles" option there is a black triangle - click the triangle, and
        check the "Primary vertical" option (like <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="vertical_title.jpeg">this</a><span class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img
              src="vertical_title.jpeg"></span></span>). You will see that "Axis
        Title" is now showing on the y-axis. Double click the inserted Y-axis
        title and change it to "Weight (kg)". </p>
      <p>Finally, click on the legend (the blue square with Total next to it)
        and delete it.</p>
      <p><input name="cb23" type="checkbox">F. Select the entire graph by
        clicking into the white space in the upper right (you will see a "Chart
        Area" popup if you hover your pointer in this area), right-click and
        copy the graph.</p>
      <p>Select cell K1 and right-click, and under "Paste options" use the
        "Picture" option (the one on the right). This will paste a picture of
        the graph, which won't change when you change the pivot table.</p>
      <p><input name="cb24" type="checkbox">G. Change the pivot table to group
        by Sex in the columns, and to group by Month in the rows. You'll see the
        chart updates so that there are two bars for each month on the x-axis,
        one for males and one for females, with sex indicated by color. </p>
      <p>Now that we have color coding to interpret we need that legend back, so
        click on the + and check the box next to "Legend".</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="scaling">2. What is the nature of the relationship
        between weight and measured lengths?</h2>
      <p> Lengths and volumes of simple geometric objects, like cubes and
        spheres, have power function relationships. Power functions raise a
        variable to an exponent (as opposed to exponential functions which raise
        a logarithmic base to the power of a variable). </p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Cube on linear-linear axes" src="cube_lin_lin.png" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px"><img
                alt="Cube on log-log axes" src="cube_log_log.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px">
              <p>For example, the volume of a cube is v = l<sup>3</sup>, where l
                is the length of one side, and since length is raised to an
                exponent this is a power function. </p>
              <p>Equivalently, we can express the relationship between volume
                and length as l = v<sup>1/3</sup>; volume is being raised to an
                exponent, so this too is a power function. A plot of length vs.
                volume is shown to the left.</p>
              <p>If we take the log of both sides of the equation, we get log(l)
                = 1/3 log(v), which is the equation for a straight line with an
                intercept of 0 and a slope of 1/3. You can see that both length
                and volume are on a log scale, so when we put the graph on a log
                scale for both axes the line straightens out, like the example
                on the right. If we ask Excel for a trend line and its equation,
                it tells us that y = x<sup>0.3333</sup>, which is what we were
                expecting.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Cube on linear-linear axes" src="sphere_lin_lin.png" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px"><img
                alt="Cube on log-log axes" src="sphere_log_log.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px">
              <p>Similarly, we can derive the relationship between diameter and
                volume of a sphere in the same way: volume of a sphere is v =
                4/3 Ï€ (d/2)<sup>3</sup>, where d is the radius from the center
                of the sphere to a point on the surface. The relationship
                between volume and radius is thus d = (6/(4Ï€))<sup>1/3</sup>v<sup>1/3</sup>.
                On a log scale this becomes log(d) = log((6/(4Ï€))<sup>1/3</sup>)+
                1/3 log(v). Although log((6/(4Ï€))<sup>1/3</sup>) is more
                complex, it is still just a constant, and will be the intercept
                for a straight line on a log-log plot. With the same slope for
                both cubes and spheres the lines will be parallel, but the
                difference in intercept will make the line for the sphere
                intersect the y-axis higher than the the line for the cube does.</p>
              <p>The graph for a sphere on a linear plot, and on a log-log plot
                are shown to the left and right, respectively. The trend line's
                equation shows that the exponent is still 0.3333, and the only
                difference is that the constant is equal to 1.2407, which is
                equal to (6/(4Ï€))<sup>1/3</sup>.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>So, with simple, solid geometric objects we expect the exponent on the
        power function to be 1/3, and the only difference between objects will
        be the intercept term.</p>
      <p>We can't calculate the volume of bears by submerging them in water and
        recording the volume of water displaced for practical reasons. However,
        we can expect the weight of the bear to be proportional to its volume,
        and weight is relatively easy to measure. We would expect a power
        function relationship between bear weights and linear dimensions, with
        an exponent of 1/3, if bears were simple geometric objects.</p>
      <p>However, bears are complex geometric objects, not simple ones. Although
        we have reason to expect bears will have a power function relationship
        between weight and linear dimensions, we can't be certain that the
        exponent will be exactly 1/3. Studying the scaling relationships between
        different body dimensions and weight is called <strong>allometry</strong>,
        and allometric scaling relationships typically take the form of a power
        function.</p>
      <p>We will start by making a scatter plot of the lengths of the bears vs.
        their weights, and will then change the axes to log scales to confirm
        that a power function is the right relationship between length and
        weight. Once we are confident this is the case, we can use Excel's trend
        lines to give us the equation that describes the relationship.</p>
      <h3>Graphing length vs weight</h3>
      <p> <input name="cb7" type="checkbox">A. To begin, you will make the
        basic plot of length vs. weight, with weight on the x-axis, and length
        the y-axis.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> To do this you need to select the cells that have the weights, and the
        cells that have the lengths, including the column headings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Select the cells E1 through E144, which have the weights. You can do
        this by selecting E1, scrolling to the bottom of the sheet and holding
        down SHIFT while you click cell E144.</p>
      <p>Now we need to select the lengths, but they are in a column that isn't
        touching the currently selected cells. To select a "discontinuous" block
        of cells, hold down the CTRL key while you click on Length in cell I1,
        and then drag down to cell I144 (holding CTRL the whole time). Once you
        have selected down to I144 you can release the mouse button and the CTRL
        key.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Now, switch to the "Insert" tab, and select "Scatter", then "<a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="scatterplot1.jpg">Scatter with points only</a><span
          class="ipt">Scatter with points only<span class="ip"><img src="scatterplot1.jpg"></span></span>".
        You'll see that Weight is taken as the x-axis, and length is on the
        y-axis. By default both axes are linear, so if the points were scattered
        around a straight line you would conclude you had a linear relationship.
        The column names are used as labels in the legend (which we don't really
        need with only one variable).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb8" type="checkbox">B. The graph is missing some axis
        labels, so click on the + and check "Axis titles" to add both x- and
        y-axis titles. Change the x-axis title to "Weight", and the y-axis title
        to "Length".</p>
      <p>You can also change the graph title from "Length" to "Linear
        Relationship", and delete the legend.</p>
      <p>Now, copy the graph, and paste it as a picture below the original.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><input name="cb9" type="checkbox">C. Change the axis scaling to
        determine the relationship between weight and length.</p>
      <p>On the original version of the graph, click on one of the numbers on
        the y-axis to select the axis. Then, right-click and select "Format
        axis". Check the box next to "Logarithmic scale" - you'll see the graph
        now has a logarithmic y-axis, in which each tick indicates a 10-fold
        change in length. The data don't look very straight with this graph, but
        if they did we would conclude the relationship was exponential, so
        change the chart title to "Exponential". </p>
      <p>Copy the exponential graph and paste it as a picture below the linear
        scale graph.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Now, change the y-axis back to a linear scale by un-checking the
        logarithmic scale checkbox. Next, click on one of the numbers on the
        X-axis to select it, right-click and select "Format axis", and set the
        x-axis to a logaritmic scale. The X-axis is now on a logarithmic scale,
        but the Y-axis is on a linear scale, and if the points fell along a
        straight line we would conclude the relationship was logarithmic -
        change the title to "Logarithmic". It's looking better than the
        exponential plot, but we have one more to go.</p>
      <p>Copy the logarithmic plot and paste it below the exponential plot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Now we can try a log-log plot. Click on the Y-axis, right-click and
        select "Format axis". Keep weight on a logarithmic scale, and set length
        to also have a logarithmic scale. You now have both axes on logarithmic
        scales, so this is a "log-log" plot. The data series are nearly straight
        lines, indicating that there is a power function relationship between
        length and weight, as we expected. Change the title to "Power".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The power graph shows the relationship we expected, and the points look
        nice and linear, so we can fit a trend line and get the equation for it.</p>
      <h3>Trend lines</h3>
      <p>The four different possible functional relationships we explored by
        changing x and y axes to log scale are shown below. Hover over each to

          </span></a> </div>
      <p>Now that we're sure that there is a power function relationship between
        length and weight, we can have Excel fit the appropriate trend line to
        the data, and give us the equation.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb10" type="checkbox">D. Select one of the points on the
        graph, then right-click and select "Add trendline". In the "Format
        Trendline" window that pops up, select "Power", and check "Display
        equation on chart". Switch to the "Fill and line" section (click on the
        pouring paint can), and change the color to black. Change the "Dash
        type" to a solid, un-dashed line, and increase the width to 2; this will
        make the line easier to see on the graph.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The equation is a little hard to see, so select it and drag it into
        the white background where you can read it. Remember that with a simple
        geometric solid the scaling relationship between length and volume is a
        1/3 exponent, but here the relationship is 0.2494. For an irregular
        object we tend to get smaller volumes for a given length, so this
        smaller exponent is expected.</p>
      <p>Once you know what the relationship is it's perfectly acceptable to
        plot on a linear scale, in which case the power function is a curved
        line. Set both of the axes back to a linear scale, and you'll see that
        the power function is now a curve through the data on the graph.</p>
      <p><input name="cb10b" type="checkbox">E. Repeat this set of steps using
        one of the other length variables of your choice (head.l, head.w,
        neck.g, or chest.g). Find the graph that gives the most linear
        relationship, name the relationship (as linear, exponential,
        logarithmic, or power), and add a trendline with equation. Copy and
        paste as picture each of the graphs you make.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="comparing_lines">3. Is there a difference in the
        length/weight relationship of male and female bears?</h2>
      <p> To compare the length/width relationship we will need to plot two
        different scatter plots on the same graph, one for each sex. If you
        remember from using MINITAB in your stat class, we could just identify a
        grouping variable to automatically separate the data for plotting, but
        Excel can't do this. In Excel you either need to re-arrange your data so
        that each sex is in a different column, or you need to plot one sex
        first, and then add the other to the graph manually. We will use the
        second approach: we will plot the females first, then add the male data
        manually.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb11" type="checkbox">A. Sort the data by sex. Switch to
        the raw data sheet, and select cell D1 (which has the column label Sex).
        On the "Home" tab, find "Sort and Filter" in the "Editing" block (right
        side of the tool bar). Click on "Sort and Filter" â†’ "Sort A to Z". Since
        all of the columns are touching this will sort the whole data set.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb12" type="checkbox">B. Plot Length against Weight for
        females. Weight will be on the X-axis, length on the Y-axis. To do this
        select the Weight data for the females, including the column label (so,
        cells E1 to E45). Then, hold down the CTRL key, and select the Length
        data (I1 to I45). Once both are selected, switch to the "Insert" tab,
        and select a "Scatter" plot with no connecting lines.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb14" type="checkbox">C. Add an x-axis label (Weight
        (lb)) and a y-axis label (Length (in)). Change the plot title to
        "Length/weight by sex".</p>
      <p> <input name="cb15" type="checkbox">D. Add the male data. This is done
        in several steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Select one of the female points on the graph, right-click, and
            choose "Select data". </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the window that pops up, select "<a class="link" style="display: none"
              href="add_series1.jpeg">Add</a><span class="ipt">Add<span class="ip"><img
                  src="add_series1.jpeg"></span></span> " for the "Legend
            Entries" box. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the window that pops up, use "Males" as the series name. Click
            on the "zoom box" (the little box next to the blank) for the "Series
            X values", and select the weights for the males (these are in cells
            E46 to E144). Then, click on the "zoom box" for the "Series Y
            values" and select the cells with lengths for the males (these are
            in cells I46 to I144).&nbsp; When you click "OK" you will be
            returned to the "Select Data Source" window.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>While you're in the "Select Data Source" window click on the female
            series (which is probably called "Length" at the moment), select
            "Edit", and change the name to "Females". Close the window when
            you're done. You should now have a scatter for both males and
            females on the same plot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Add a legend to the graph, which will identify which sex is assigned
          which color.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <input name="cb16" type="checkbox">E. Add a trend line for each sex.
        Click on the scatter for one of the sexes, right-click and select "Add
        trendline". Select a "Power" curve, and click select the "Display
        equation on chart" check box. Repeat for the other sex. Move the
        equations so that they are readable.</p>
      <p>You'll see that the line for males is steeper than for females - at
        lighter weights the males are shorter than females, but at heavier
        weights the males are longer.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="line_scatter">4. How does body weight vary from month
        to month?</h2>
      <p> Finally, we are interested in how measured weights change from month
        to month. We will need a pivot table with average weights each month by
        sex, and then a pivot chart showing these averages.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb18" type="checkbox">A. Make a new pivot table (don't
        modify the one you already made, make a new one in its own worksheet).
        Use Month as the row labels, Sex as the column labels, and average of
        Weight as the data.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb19" type="checkbox">B. Use PivotChart to make a line
        graph of weights for each sex by month. Since all the months from April
        through November are represented a line graph will look fine, because
        even spacing between months is appropriate. Add a PivotChart using a
        line graph as the graph type. Choose the type with <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="line_graph.jpeg">overlapping lines and with symbols showing</a><span
          class="ipt">overlapping lines and with symbols showing<span class="ip"><img
              src="line_graph.jpeg"></span></span>.</p>
      <p> Add a chart title ("Weights by month - line"), x-axis title ("Month"),
        and y-axis title ("Weight").</p>
      <p><input name="cb20" type="checkbox">C. What you do next is to make a
        point - add a linear trend line for males, with equation. to the graph.
        You'll notice that Excel doesn't stop you, or warn you that this is a
        bad idea, but it is indeed a bad idea.</p>
      <p>The reason that you shouldn't add trend lines to line graphs is that <strong>line
          graphs have categorical x-axes</strong>. Even though the months are
        coded using numbers, Excel treats these as though they are just category
        labels, and doesn't use the months in the trend line estimate. Instead
        Excel assigns numbers to the month categories of its own, starting with
        1 and going up to 8, and it is these arbitrary category numbers that it
        uses in its trend line fitting. Excel doesn't tell you that's what it's
        doing, but that is in fact what it's doing.</p>
      <p>So, if we want to use the trend line option to get an equation for
        change over time then we can't use the line graph. The correct graph
        type is the scatter plot, which has a numeric axis for both x and y.</p>
      <p><input name="cb21" type="checkbox">D. We can make a graph that looks
        nearly identical to the line graph but with a numeric x-axis if we use a
        scatter plot with connecting lines. We can't use a scatterplot in a
        pivot chart, so we first have to extract the data. You can do this by
        selecting the table (cells A3 through D13), copying it, and then doing a
        paste-special of the values in the cells below the pivot table (select
        cell A20 and use the "Values" paste option to paste the numbers without
        the pivot table formatting).</p>
      <p>Next, select the Months, Female, and Male weights from the values you
        just pasted - do not include the totals. If you pasted your table into
        cell A20, then the range to select is A21:C29.</p>
      <p>While the cells are selected, insert a scatterplot, with straight
        connecting lines (<a class="link" style="display: none" href="scatter_connect_lines.png">this</a><span
          class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img src="scatter_connect_lines.png"></span></span>
        one).</p>
      <p>The graph produced looks very similar to the line graph, but with some
        subtle differences. First, the scaling is different, but we could make
        them nearly identical by fiddling with the x-axis scaling. The other
        difference is that the tick marks in the line graph fall between the
        numbers, whereas they are directly above the numbers on the scatterplot.
        This is a visual cue to you that the line graph is treating the numbers
        as categories, whereas the scatter plot uses them as numeric values.</p>
      <p>Add the axis labels as in the line graph. Use the chart title "Weights
        by month - scatter".</p>
      <p><input name="cb22" type="checkbox">E. Add a trend line for males to the
        scatterplot, with equation. You'll see that the slopes are the same for
        the two versions of this graph, but the intercepts are not the same. The
        reason that they don't match is that the line graph's trend line is
        bogus. The slopes are only the same because, coincidentally, the spacing
        between the months is 1 unit, just like the numbers that Excel assigns
        the months in the line graph, but that won't always be true. The
        intercept is the length expected when month is equal to 0. In the
        scatterplot, month 0 is four less than the lowest month in the data set
        (which is 4), but in the line graph the number assigned to the lowest
        month is 1, which puts 0 just one unit below. The difference between
        these is 3 units, and if you multiply the slope by 3 you get (6.2385 x
        3) = 18.72, which is the amount of difference between the intercepts
        (173.19 - 154.47 = 18.72).</p>
      <p>I don't know why Excel allows you to do things like this, but it does,
        so you can't rely on Excel to keep you out of trouble. You have to know
        what the graphs are, and how to use them correctly. Thus, even though it
        lets you, don't fit a trend line to a line graph.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="pivotchart">5. When are most of the measurements made
        in the data set?</h2>
      <p>We are going to generate some counts of numbers of observations by
        month, and then look at our graphing options for this kind of data.</p>
      <p><input name="cb101" type="checkbox">A. Switch back to the data set and
        make a new pivot table in a new worksheet. This time use Month as both
        the rows and as the value field. Change the statistic from sum to count.</p>
      <p><input name="cb102" type="checkbox">B. Make a pivot chart, using the
        pie chart. Pie charts are only appropriate for displaying compositional
        data - proportions, relative frequencies, or percentages. The data we
        used are counts (frequencies) rather than proportions or percentages,
        but since proportions are just frequencies divided by the total number
        of data points, and percentages are just proportions multiplied by 100,
        Excel will do the necessary conversion for you.</p>
      <p>When you display counts in a pie chart the purpose is to get a visual
        impression of which months were most common in the data set. The actual
        values are not displayed, however, which makes it impossible to tell
        what the actual number of data points is. We can fix that by clicking on
        the + and selecting "Data labels" (if you click on the triangle next to
        "Data labels" you'll see you have some choices about where to put them -
        the default position inside the slices is fine).</p>
      <p>Change the graph name to "Months that bears were observed". Copy the
        graph and paste as a picture below the graph.</p>
      <p><input name="cb103" type="checkbox">C. If we wanted the pie chart to
        express the data as percentages, we need to change the settings on the
        Pivot Table to show percentages, click on +, then "Data labels", then
        click the triangle and select "More options". Check the box next to
        "Percentage", and the values are shown as percentages instead of counts.
        You can change the separator to period as well (it defaults to a comma,
        which is the European convention for the decimal point).</p>
      <p>Copy and paste a picture of this graph below the other pie chart
        picture.</p>
      <p><input name="cb104" type="checkbox">D. A pie chart is fine for a single
        set of frequencies, but if we want to compare the frequencies between
        the sexes we'll need a different chart type. You can change the chart
        type under "PIVOTCHART TOOLS", tab "Design", option "Change Chart Type".
        Another good option for displaying counts made in two or more categories
        is a clustered column chart. Select this type.</p>
      <p>Now, add "Sex" as a column variable in your pivot table. The chart
        should update to show two bars per month, one for each sex. Since we
        have a y-axis now we don't need to label the bars, so click + and
        un-check data labels.</p>
      <p>Add axis labels, and call the x-axis "Month", and the y-axis "Count".</p>
      <p>Copy and paste this graph below your last pie chart.</p>
      <p><input name="cb105" type="checkbox">E. You can change the y-axis to a
        percent scale, but it's not an axis option for this chart type. Instead
        we need to make the change to the Pivot Table. Double-click on "Count of
        Month", and select the "Show Values As" tab. Drop down the menu for
        "Show values as" and select "% of Column Total" - since the column total
        is all of the females or all of the males, this will give the percentage
        of female observations each month, and the percent of male observations
        each month. You'll see that the y-axis is not on a percent scale in you
        graph.</p>
      <p>Change the y-axis label to "Percent", and copy/paste a picture below
        your previous graph.</p>
      <p><input name="cb106" type="checkbox">F. Instead of focusing on how the
        counts are distributed among months, we might be interested in comparing
        the relative number of males and females between the months. We can do
        this with a stacked column chart.</p>
      <p>First, put the Count of Month settings back to count units instead of
        percentages (set "Show Values As" to "No Calculation").</p>
      <p>Next, change the layout. You'll see that you have a choice between a
        stacked column (which puts the counts for males on top of the counts for
        females), and a 100% stacked column (which expresses the data as the
        percent males and females each month, with the bars all going to 100%).
        Both are fine, but if we want to make the comparison of the sex ratio
        each month easy, we want all the bars to be the same height and the
        relative amount of each color to indicate the percent of observatons
        that were each sex. Select the 100% stacked column chart. You'll see
        that just like with a pie chart Excel has done the math for you and set
        the y-axis to a percent scale.</p>
      <p>Change the y-axis label to "Percent".</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="radar">6. How do the sexes compare across all of the
        variables?</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We have six different measurements of the sizes of the bears, so to
        compare them across all six variables we need a graph with six
        dimensions. Radar charts are just such a graph, so we will give them a
        try next.</p>
      <p><input name="cb107" type="checkbox">A. Make one more pivot table, this
        time with sex as the column labels, and weight, head.w, head.l, neck.g,
        length, and chest.g as value fields. Change all of these from sum to
        average, and for the "Show Values As" tab select "% of row total" for
        all (the graph doesn't work well if you're plotting variables with
        different units, so since we want to compare males and females we can
        divide each sex's mean by the mean overall - since percentages are
        unit-less ratios this makes the comparison between sexes on the graph
        easier). Drag the sigma values button into the rows so that each average
        is in its own row.</p>
      <p><input name="cb108" type="checkbox">B. Insert a pivot chart, and select
        the "Radar" option. You'll see that each ray on the radar is a different
        variable axis, with all of them starting at 0 in the center. The means
        for each sex is plotted on each axis, and then the means are connected
        with lines to make it easy to compare the sexes. You can see that the
        female's line is inside of the male's line, which means the males are
        bigger on all of the variables.&nbsp;</p>
