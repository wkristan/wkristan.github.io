      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Arrays and matrices are closely related terms. Arrays are computer data
        structures that store data in rows and columns. Matrices are
        mathematical structures made up of rows and columns. Mathematicians and
        computer scientists may be able to tell you how they are different, but
        we will use the terms interchangeably in here.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Array formulas in Excel work on arrays of data. They can return a
        single cell or an array of cells, but they all take a range of cells as
        input and give one or more cells as output. We indicate that a formula
        is an array formula by using CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to enter the formula,
        which prompts Excel to execute operations on each of the input cells.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> There are three kinds of applications of array formulas we will learn
        today:</p>
      <p> 1. Spreadsheet formulas and functions that only work correctly as
        array formulas</p>
      <p> 2. Formulas that can be either array formulas or standard cell
        formulas, but are more compact and efficient when used as array formulas</p>
      <p> 3. Matrix math</p>

      <h2 class="part" id="frequency">Frequency function</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Our first example of a formula that must be an array formula to work is
        frequency(). A very important step in analyzing data is to assess the
        distribution of the data so that we can pick the right analysis
        procedures for it. For a continuous variable we can't just count
        repeated data values, because there may not be any. Instead, we need to
        break up continuous numbers into bins, then count the number of data
        values in each bin. As an example, we will be working with data on
        diameters of trees, which are distributed like this:</p>
      <img alt="Histogram with rug" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 730px; height: 284px;"
        src="histo_rug.png">
      <p>Individual data values are shown as hash marks below the histogram. You
        can see that it's really difficult to tell from the individual data
        points alone that there is a concentration of data values in the middle,
        with diameters becoming less common at increasingly large or small
        values. But, if you break up the x-axis into sections, called bins, you
        can count up how many trees' diameters fall into each bin - this clearly
        shows that the diameter measures follow a typical, bell-shaped
        distribution.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Excel just added support for histograms with Excel
        2016, but we are going to learn how to do them the old fashioned way
        because it will give us a chance to learn how to use the frequency()
        array formula (and because Excel 2016's histograms use appallingly bad
        x-axis labels, and we can do better).</p>
      <p style="clear: both">The frequency() array formula is useful for
        calculating frequencies of data values within bins that we specify. The
        bins don't have to be evenly spaced, but we will use bins of equal size
        here.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb1" type="checkbox">A. Open the spreadsheet, and switch
        to sheet "Frequency". You'll see a column of 200 tree diameters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb2" type="checkbox">B. Create bins of tree diameter. In
        cell D1, type "Bins". This is where you will define the ranges of
        diameter within which you'll count frequencies of occurrence. The bins
        aren't created automatically, so you'll need to create your own.</p>
      <p>First we need to decide how many bins to use. There are various ways of
        calculating an appropriate number, but a simple one is Sturges' rule,
        which sets the number of bins as log2(n) + 1, rounded to the nearest
        whole number. By this criterion, we would want log2(200) + 1 = 8.64
        bins, which rounds to 9.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The next step is to decide what the upper and lower limits of the bins
        should be. Start by finding the minimum and maximum values; in cell g1
        "Minimum", and in h1 type <span class="Excel">=min(a2:a201)</span>.
        This will give you the minimum data value. In cell g2 type "Maximum",
        and in h2 type <span class="Excel">=max(a2:a201)</span>, which will
        give you the maximum. The width of the bins is the difference between
        the maximum and minimum divided by the number of bins. We're going to
        define the first bin when we pick a starting point in the next step, so
        we'll divide the range (max - min) by 8 in order to end up with 9 bins
        total. In g3 type "Bin width", and in h3 type <span class="Excel">=round(
          (h2-h1)/8, 0)</span>. This gives you the width of each bin to the
        nearest whole number.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The number entered in the row for a bin is the upper limit of the bin.
        The lower end of the bin is determined by the value in the cell in the
        previous row. For the first row, there won't be a previous row, so it
        will count the number of observations from the upper limit you enter to
        negative infinity. </p>
      <p>In cell d2 type in the nearest whole number larger than the minimum
        (so, if the minimum was 4.3, type 5 in d2). Then, in d3 type <span class="Excel">=d2+h$3</span>
        which will calculate the next bin by taking the previous one and adding
        the bin width in cell h3. Finally, copy d3 and paste it into the next
        seven cells below. This should give you nine bins, with the upper bin
        having a value of 69, just above the maximum you calculated in h2.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb3" type="checkbox">C. Now everything is set up, so you
        can calculate the frequencies. The structure of the frequency() command
        is: frequency(data array, bins array). The "data array" argument is the
        range of cells that holds the data, and "bins array" are the bins to use
        to calculate frequencies. In cell e1 type "Frequency". Now, select cells
        e2 through e10, which should include all of the cells adjacent to your
        bins. You'll see that the first cell stays active, while the rest are
        selected but are darkened. Type <span class="Excel">=frequency(a2:a201,
          d2:d10)</span>, and hit <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER</strong>. You should
        now see frequencies next to each bin.</p>
      <p><input name="cb3" type="checkbox">D. To make a histogram, you first
        need to calculate the midpoints for the bins. The numbers in the "bins"
        column are all the upper limit of the bins, but Excel will want to put
        the labels for the bars on the graph you will make in the middle of the
        bar instead of at the upper limit. The midpoints are 1/2 of the bin
        width below the upper limit.</p>
      <p>Enter "Midpoints" into cell c1, and in cell c2 enter <span class="Excel">=d2-h$3/2</span>.
        Copy and paste this to the seven rows below, and you now have midpoints
        for every bin.</p>
      <p>Make a bar chart for the frequencies, and use the midpoints as the
        x-axis labels. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the frequencies in E and insert a column chart (the
          "clustered column" type is fine, there is only one column of data so
          you will get a simple column chart from this).</li>
        <li>Select the bars, right-click and select "Select data...". Click on
          the "Edit" button in the "Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels" and
          select the midpoints - you'll see that the labels are now the
          midpoints from column C below each bar.</li>
        <li>Right-click the bars again and select "Format data series...". Set
          both the series overlap and gap width to 0.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You now have a histogram with labels that indicate the middle of the
        bin. You can add an x-axis title of "Diameter", and a y-axis title of
        "Frequency", and the graph is complete.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="grouped">Array formulas for summarizing grouped data</h2>
      <p> A spreadsheet is easier to read and understand when you only display
        the things that are needed to interpret the data. For example, a sheet
        that shows columns full of intermediate steps in a complex calculation
        is difficult to understand, because only the final step of the
        calculation is meant to be interpreted. Array formulas can greatly
        increase the clarity and interpretability of a spreadsheet by allowing
        you to do complex calculations in a single cell, so that only the result
        of the calculation is displayed.</p>
      <p>To illustrate use of array formulas, we will calculate a mean and
        standard deviation from grouped data on numbers of aphids on a sample of
        100 tomato leaves from a garden.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb4" type="checkbox">A. Switch to sheet "Grouped data".
        You'll see that you have a column of data called "Number of aphids" and
        one called "Frequency" giving the number of times that each number of
        aphids was counted out of 100 plants.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb5" type="checkbox">B. In cell A14 write "Mean". In
        cell B14 type <span class="Excel">=sum(a2:a12*b2:b12)/sum(b2:b12)</span>
        and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. You now have an array formula giving the mean
        for the data.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Why does this work? The a2:a12*b2:b12 argument in the numerator
        multiplies each number of aphids by its frequency, and then the sum()
        function sums the products - this gives us the sum of the number of
        aphids observed across all the leaves, which is the numerator of an
        arithmetic mean. The sum of the frequencies in the denominator is just
        the number of leaves counted, which is the denominator for an arithmetic
        mean.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb6" type="checkbox">C. We're going to do the standard
        deviation now. </p>
      <p>Before we move on to the calculation, though, a quick caution about
        complex formulas. If you recall from last week, we avoided having cells
        with intermediate steps of calculation in our spreadsheet by nesting
        calculations within a single cell formula, and array formulas allow us
        to take this approach to the next level. However, as we learned about
        nested formulas last week, it is harder to check for errors when you're
        hiding calculations within a complex cell formula. You should be
        especially vigilant about double-checking your results if you use array
        formulas - the potential for errors increases as formulas become more
        complex, and array formulas allow you to build very complex
        calculations.</p>
      <p>We will address this issue in our calculation of the standard deviation
        by doing the calculation two ways - once without using array formulas at
        all, in small steps that are easy to error check, and then when we're
        confident we got it right, we will do the calculation again with an
        array formula that does the entire calculation in a single cell.</p>
      <p>First we'll work on the numerator of a standard deviation, the "sum of
        squares". In cell C1 type "Squared differences", and in cell C2 type <span
          class="Excel">=(a2 - b$14)^2</span>. This is the squared difference
        between 0 aphids and the mean of 2.38. Since you used a dollar sign in
        front of the row reference for the mean, you can copy and paste this
        formula to the rest of the rows (through C12).</p>
      <p>Next, in cell D1 type "Diffs x Freqs". In cell D2 type <span class="Excel">=b2*c2</span>.
        Since there were 10 times that 0 aphids were observed, the squared
        difference in cell C2 should also be counted 10 times - multiplying C2
        by B2 accomplishes this. Copy cell D2 and paste to the rest of the rows
        (through D12).</p>
      <p>Now, in cell A15 type "SD". In cell B15 we are going to sum the diffs x
        freqs, divide by the sample size minus 1 (the degrees of freedom), and
        then take the square root to get our standard deviation. In cell B15
        type <span class="Excel">=sqrt(sum(d2:d12)/(sum(b2:b12)-1))</span>.
        This is not an array formula, because there is no per-cell operation
        being done. The denominator sums the frequencies, which gives us the
        sample size, and then subtracts 1 to give us degrees of freedom. The
        square root of the sums of squares divided by the degrees of freedom is
        the standard deviation.</p>
      <p><input name="cb7" type="checkbox">D. Now that we're confident we know
        what the correct value is, we can do all these calculations in a single
        cell, using an array formula.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In cell A16 type "SD, one cell". In cell B16 type the formula "=<span style="color: #009900;">sqrt(</span><span
          style="color: #cc33cc;">sum(</span><span style="color: #3366ff;">b2:b12*</span><span
          style="color: red;">(a2:a12 - b14)^2</span><span style="color: #cc33cc;">)</span>/<span
          style="color: #ff9900;">(sum(b2:b12)-1)</span><span style="color: #009900;">)</span>"
        and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. You should see the same value reported as in
        cell B15. If you look at this formula, the part that calculates the
        squared differences is in red - an array formula is needed to do this
        step, because the mean in b14 is subtracted from each cell in a2:a12,
        and each difference is then squared. These squared differences are then
        multiplied by their corresponding frequencies, in dark blue - this
        multiplication step also requires an array formula, because the
        frequency in b2 is multiplied by the squared difference for a2, then the
        frequency in b3 is multiplied by the squared difference for a3, and so
        on. The sum of squares is calculated as the sum of squared diffs x
        freqs, indicated in purple. The degrees of freedom are calculated by
        summing the frequencies in b2 through b12, and then subtracting one, in
        orange. The slash in the middle divides the sum of squares by the
        degrees of freedom, and then the sqrt() function takes the square root
        of the result, in green.</p>
      <p>The advantage of this complicated formula is that you wouldn't need the
        "squared differences" or "Diffs x freqs" columns, which are just
        cluttering up the worksheet - they aren't meant to be interpreted, they
        are just steps in the calculation of the standard deviation. If you were
        doing this calculation for your own data analysis project, you could
        delete those columns and the sd calculation in row 15, and just retain
        the sd calculation in cell B16, once you know it's right - don't do
        that, though, because I want to see both of your calculations.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="matrix_pop">Responses to selection on genetically
        correlated traits</h2>
      <img alt="Chinook" src="chinook_salmon.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
      <p>Size-selective harvesting refers to the practice of preferentially
        taking a particular size of a harvested species. This image of a Chinook
        salmon on the left is an example of a species that is harvested in this
        way - commercial harvesting focuses on the largest individuals because
        they are the most profitable, and sport fishing regulations have minimum
        sizes to keep a fish that you catch (not to mention that anglers prefer
        to catch the biggest ones).</p>
      <p>Since salmon are a biological organism, we can expect that if the way
        we harvest makes it dangerous for them to be large they will evolve
        smaller size.</p>
      <p>Size is a phenotypic trait - the way the organism looks or functions.
        The size of a salmon is affected both by its genes, and by environmental
        factors. To some degree, big parents are big because their genes make
        them big, and they will be able to pass those genes on to their
        offspring, which will make their offspring big as well. But,
        environmental influences that act on a salmon as it grows (such as the
        water temperatures, how well fed they were, etc.) can't be passed on
        from parents to offspring. To understand how size-selective harvesting
        would affect the size of salmon we will need to know how <strong>heritable</strong>
        the trait is - that is, how well a parent's body size predicts its
        offspring's body sizes. We will use a measure called heritability,
        symbolized h<sup>2</sup>, to represent this part of the process.</p>
      <p>The other thing we will need to know is how selective the harvesting
        is. If every single one of the largest individuals are removed from the
        population before they breed then only smaller individuals will be left
        to breed, and you can expect a large change in size in the offspring
        generation. If some of the biggest individuals are taken but many still
        remain, the amount of change in the next generation will be smaller. The
        difference in average size of adults before harvest and after harvest is
        called the <strong>selection differential</strong>. We will represent
        the selection differential with the letter s.</p>
      <img alt="Response to selection" src="Response_to_selection.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
      <p>This illustration shows how heritability and selection differentials
        produce change in size over time. The top panel shows the parental
        population before size-selective harvesting (the big curve, with a mean
        at 5), and the population of parents after size-selective harvesting
        (the smaller curve, with a mean at 3). The difference between the means
        before and after harvest is s.</p>
      <p> What we actually want to know is how much change in size to expect
        from one generation to the next - that is, we want to know the <strong>response</strong>
        to selection. The bottom panel shows the offspring generation that would
        be produced by the surviving parents. The mean for the offspring is at 4
        - this is neither at the pre-harvest parental mean (5) or the
        after-harvest mean (3), it is right in between. This happens because
        some of the smaller salmon in the parental population carried genes for
        larger body size, but environmental effects prevented them from
        achieving a large size - the environmental effects are not heritable, so
        the next generation falls between the pre-harvest and post-harvest
        means. The amount of change from the pre-harvest mean to the offspring
        mean is the response to selection, R.</p>
      <p>The equation that predicts the response to selection based on the size
        of the selection differential and the heritability of the trait is
        called the "breeder's formula", which is:</p>
      <p>R = h<sup>2</sup>S</p>
      <p>That is, the amount of change we can expect in the average trait value
        from one generation to the next (R) is equal to the heritability (h<sup>2</sup>)
        multiplied by the selection differential (S).</p>
      <p>The breeder's formula works well for one trait at a time, but organisms
        are integrated units, not collections of independent traits. When you
        select on body weight, you end up changing all sorts of other traits as
        well. Fishers may not care what the growth rate of the salmon they catch
        was, and may not directly target fish based on whether they grow rapidly
        or slowly, but the size of the fish may be related to how rapidly they
        grow, and selecting on size may indirectly affect the growth rate as
        well. The selective pressure put on traits due to their correlation with
        a trait that is directly under selection is called <strong>indirect
          selection</strong>.</p>
      <p>To understand indirect selection, we need to use keep track of several
        traits at once, and account for the correlations between them.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">If you switch to the "Matrix" tab you'll see an
        example of a variance-covariance (G) matrix that comes from a study by
        Hard (2004). Variance-covariance matrices are organized like a
        correlation matrix, which you may have seen before - the row labels and
        column labels are the same, and the body of the matrix holds variances
        when the row and column labels match, and holds covariances between two
        variables when the row and column labels are different. Since the row
        and column labels match in a diagonal from the upper left to the lower
        right corner of the matrix, this is called the <strong>main diagonal</strong>
        of the matrix. The main diagonal is made up of genetic variances, which
        are equivalent to the heritabilities in the breeder's formula.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">The numbers above the main diagonal are the <strong>upper
          triangle</strong>, those below the main diagonal are the <strong>lower
          triangle</strong>, and if you compare them the upper and lower
        triangles are mirror images of one another - since the row and column
        labels are the same, they pair up once when one variable is in the row
        and one is in the column, and again when the first variable is in the
        column and the second is in the row.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Covariances are like correlations that haven't been
        standardized - they indicate how two variables change relative to one
        another, but they still have the original data units. It's harder to
        compare covariances to one another because different pairs of variables
        have different units, but you should be able to see that all of the
        covariances in the G matrix are positive - this means that in every case
        as one variable increases so does the other (and, as one decreases the
        other decreases too).</p>
      <p style="clear: both">When we work with covariances we need a different
        form of selection differential - we use <strong>selection gradients</strong>
        instead. Selection gradients relate relative fitness to the trait value,
        which we need to convert the variances and covariances into units of
        average change in traits. We enter one gradient for each trait, and if
        the gradient is positive we are selecting for the trait value to
        increase, and if it's negative the trait value is selected to decrease.
        The gradients are scaled so that the responses to selection indicate the
        amount of change in mean to expect after one generation of selection.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Now that you know the basic setup, let's think
        about what this model will tell us about the effects of size-selective
        harvesting in salmon. Fishing selects against large fish, in that they
        are removed from the population before they can breed - to represent
        this, we will enter a negative gradient for the adult weight trait. This
        will, obviously cause adult weight to decline, but since weight is
        correlated with every other trait in this matrix we expect all of the
        other traits to change as well due to indirect selection. Additionally,
        the amount of change in weight we would expect is a combination of the
        direct selection against large size and the indirect effects of
        selection for or against the other traits. Depending on the gradients
        assigned to the other traits the change in weight could either be
        accelerated (if the gradients are all in the same direction), or slowed
        (if the gradients are in different directions).</p>
      <p style="clear: both">The way we will predict how direct and indirect
        selection produce change is to use a version of the breeder's formula
        designed for multiple correlated traits, which tells us: </p>
      <p><strong>R</strong> = <strong>Gβ</strong><br>
      </p>
      <strong>R</strong> is now a column vector, each row of which will hold the
      predicted response to selection for each variable we are tracking. <strong>G</strong>
      is the genetic variance-covariance matrix, and <strong>β</strong> is a
      column vector of selection gradients.
      <p style="clear: both">We will use this model to explore how these traits
        are expected to change as different patterns of selection are applied to
        them.</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><input type="checkbox">A. First, we need to set up
        the model. In cell H3 enter the label "Gradients". Initially we will
        only apply selection to the weight of the adults, and will leave the
        selection gradients at 0 for all the other traits - enter a 0 for adult
        age (H4), fork length (H5), spawn date (H7), and growth rate (H8), and
        enter a -0.01 for adult weight (H6).</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Enter "Responses" into cell J3. To calculate the
        responses to a generation of selection against adult weight, we need to
        matrix multiply the G matrix by the gradients. Matrix multiplication is
        an array operation in Excel, but we need to set it up correctly for it
        to work. We need to select the range of cells that will hold the matrix
        of responses, and in matrix multiplication the product will have the
        number of rows of the left matrix, and the number of columns of the
        right matrix - there are five rows in G, and one column in S, so R will
        have five rows and one column. Select cells J4 through J8.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Once you have the output range selected, type the
        formula <span class="Excel">=mmult(b4:f8,h4:h8)</span>, and then use
        CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to enter this as an array formula - if all went well
        you now have five responses, one for each trait, like <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="responses.png">this</a> <span class="ipt">this<span class="ip"><img
              src="responses.png"></span></span>.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">You can already see that there are changes in all
        of the traits because of indirect selection on them via their
        correlation with weight.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">We have a problem, though - the responses are all
        giving expected amounts of change in the trait, but all of the trait
        values have different units, and we don't know what the baseline
        starting point is for any of them. We can set all of these changes to be
        proportional changes by dividing each one by the mean trait value,
        properly transformed, but the publication that the G-matrix came from
        did not provide that information. We will use some ballpark estimates
        for each of the mean trait values so that we can compare them, but bear
        in mind that these numbers are very rough estimates.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">In cell K3 enter "Means (untransformed)", and
        enter:</p>
      <p style="clear: both">3 for adult age (K4)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">1092 for fork length (K5)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">13600 for adult weight (K6)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">318 for spawn date (K7, this is the number of days
        elapsed since the first of the year, and Chinook spawn in the fall)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">62 for growth rate (K8)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Now, we need to express these on the same scale as
        they appear in the G matrix - in cell L3 enter "Means (transformed)",
        and then enter:</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><span class="Excel">=k4^3</span> in cell L4</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><span class="Excel">=k5</span> in cell L5 (no
        transformation needed)</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><span class="Excel">=sqrt(k6)</span> in cell L6</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><span class="Excel">=ln(k7)</span> in cell L7</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><span class="Excel">=k8</span> in cell L8 (no
        transformation needed)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Finally, you need to divide the responses by these
        transformed means to get a percent change per generation. Do this in
        column M - use the label "Percent change", and divide the responses from
        J by the transformed averages in L, and then set the cells in M to a
        "Percentage" display type.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Before moving on to the next set of selection
        gradient values, copy the proportional changes from M4:M8 and
        paste-special as values in cells B12:B16 (you just need to select B12
        and paste-special). In B11 enter the label "Weight-" to indicate that
        these are the proportional responses when you select against weight.</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><input type="checkbox">B. The first scenario in
        step A imagined that fishing only exerted direct pressure on one trait,
        weight of adults, but in fact it exerts pressure on other traits as
        well. For example, growing rapidly so that you can breed before you get
        caught may be beneficial in a harvested population, and although fishing
        doesn't specifically target the slow-growing fish, there is still a
        direct benefit to rapid growth. </p>
      <p style="clear: both">To simulate this process, enter a value of 0.01
        into the gradient for spawn date - this is a positive selection
        gradient, which means we're selecting for faster growth, in addition to
        still selecting against larger size.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Copy the proportional changes from column M into
        cells C12:C16 as values, and label them "Weight-, growth+".<br>
      </p>
      <p style="clear: both"><input type="checkbox">C. By the same argument, we
        might expect that breeding younger would be beneficial. Salmon migrate
        out to sea, spend 2-4 years growing, and then return to spawn. Although
        a salmon can only choose to spawn at 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years, the
        average age can decrease or increase by fractional amounts, depending on
        how many animals of each age are spawning in a year.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">To select for younger breeding, we will negatively
        select against older breeding (adult age). Enter a value of -0.01 as the
        gradient for adult age. Copy and paste the proportional changes as
        values to column E next to the other responses, and label them "Weight-,
        growth+, age-".</p>
      <p style="clear: both"><input type="checkbox">D. We are now going to graph
        the results. Copy all of the trait labels from A4 to A8, and paste them
        next to the responses (cells A12 to A16). Set their display type to
        percentage. Add the label "Trait" to cell A11.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Then, select the range of cells that has the trait
        names, the responses, and the column headings (A11 to D16) and insert a
        line graph.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">The graph has some issues we need to fix, the first
        of which is that the traits are on the x-axis, and the series are the
        different selection gradients we used. We want the opposite - the
        gradients should be on the x-axis, and each line should be a trait. To
        swap them, select any one of the lines, right-click, and select "Select
        data".</p>
      <p style="clear: both">In the "Select Data Source" window that pops up,
        click "Switch Row/Column", and click "OK". You now have a different line
        for each trait, and you can more easily see how changing the selection
        gradients affect them.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Next, since we have both positive and negative
        changes setting the x-axis to intersect the y-axis at the origin is
        putting the labels in the middle of the graph. We would like them at the
        bottom where they belong. This is done, a little counter-intuitively, by
        changing a y-axis setting - select the y-axis by clicking on any of the
        axis labels. Switch to the axis options (click on the little histogram
        icon on the right side at the top of the window), and find the
        "Horizontal axis crosses" settings. Click on "Axis value" and set it to
        the smallest number on the y-axis in the graph, which is -0.15. You will
        now have the labels for the selection gradients at the bottom of the
        graph.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">You can change the chart title to "Responses to
        selection", and add a y-axis label of "Proportional response".</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">E. Now that you have the results, notice a few
        interesting patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selecting against heavier animals alone caused at least a little
          change in every trait. Traits that either have very little heritable
          variation, or that aren't strongly genetically correlated with weight
          (spawn date) change the least.</li>
        <li>When there is positive selection on one trait and negative selection
          on another the responses will offset one another to a degree - note
          that the amount of decline in weight expected went down a little when
          growth rate was positively selected.</li>
        <li>Indirect selection can overwhelm direct selection - when negative
          selection was applied to both weigh and age, the expected response for
          growth rate became negative again, even though there is still a
          selective advantage for rapid growth.</li>
      </ul>
