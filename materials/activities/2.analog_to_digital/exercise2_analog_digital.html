      <p>We will work today on understanding how the analog properties of
        biological systems are translated into digital representations.
        Computers have allowed the biological sciences to make huge advances,
        and have become standard scientific tools. Representing data in a
        digital form is a basic requirement of using computers. Most of the time
        this translation from analog to digital doesn't cause problems, but it's
        important for you to understand that digital representations aren't
        perfect reproductions, and problems can arise.</p>
      <p>To complete the worksheet for today's exercise, you will need to do
        several things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate decimal integer numbers to binary</li>
        <li>Express decimal continuous numbers in a floating point format</li>
        <li>Translate letters to ASCII decimal codes, and then to their binary
          equivalents</li>
        <li>Translate between colors and RGB codes</li>
        <li>Convert digital sound and image files to lossy formats, and compare
          the results to the original</li>
      </ul>
      <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">A. <strong>Translate base 10
          numbers to binary numbers</strong>.</p>
      <p>To understand how binary digits work, it's helpful to think clearly
        about what a base 10 number, like 20421, actually means. First, each
        digit in this number is an entry at a "place" - the ones place, 10's
        place, 100's place, 1000's place, and 10000's place. Each place is a
        power of 10 - you can see in this table that the powers of 10 are shown,
        with their decimal equivalent below them. The reason we use powers of 10
        is that we have ten digits possible at each place - we can represent any
        number from 0 to 9 in the 1's place, and to represent 10 we need to
        enter a 1 in the 10's place.</p>
      <p>So, 20,421 is actually:</p>
      <table class="tableLarge">
        <tbody>

      <p></p>
      <p>To represent 20,421 we enter a 2 in the 10000's place, a 0 in the
        1000's place, a 4 in the 100's place, a 2 in the 10's place, and a 1 in
        the 1's place. We then add up each of these numbers to get the decimal
        number of 20421.</p>
      <p>Binary numbers work the same way, but since the only digits we can use
        are 0 and 1, they are base 2 instead of base 10. This means that the
        "places" in a binary number are powers of 2 instead of powers of 10.</p>
      <p>With base 2, the first position, 2<sup>0</sup>, is equal to 1, just
        like the 10<sup>0</sup> position in base 10. But, since we can only use
        0's and 1's as digits, we can either have 0 or 1 of these 1's, which
        means the first position can only represent a 0 or a 1. For numbers
        bigger than 1 we need to go to the 2<sup>1</sup> place.</p>
      <p>The table below will help you translate decimal numbers into binary. To
        use it, click on the 0's in the "Binary digits" row to convert them to
        1's. Each time you turn a 0 to a 1 the "Decimal equivalent" number is
        added to the "Decimal number" value.</p>
      <p> As a simple example, to convert the decimal number 2 to binary we
        would need to put a 1 at the 2's place and a 0 at the 1's place, so that
        the sum is 2+0 = 2.</p>
      <p>To fill in the answers for Question 1 on your worksheet, use the
        converter to find the binary representations for integer numbers from 0
        to 10.</p>

      <p>Some help in finding the right pattern of 0's and 1's:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Start with the biggest decimal equivalent that is smaller than or equal to the number you are converting, and enter a 1. For the first number 
             you're converting (66), 128 is too big and should stay a 0, but 64 is smaller than 66, so it should get a 1.</li>
             <li>Work down the list of decimal equivalents, and if adding the decimal 
             equivalent to 64 either equals or is still less than 66 then put a 1 underneath it.</li>
             <li>Once your decimal number is correct, stop and record the sequence of 0's and 1's on your worksheet as the binary number - this is the binary equivalent to your decimal number.</li>
           </ul>
      <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">B. <strong>Express decimal numbers in a floating point format</strong>. As you learned in lecture, we can represent integer numbers with binary equivalents, but for numbers with decimal places 
        it is common to use floating point numbers. Floating point representations have the advantage that they can represent a very wide range of sizes of numbers with a relatively small number of bits,
        but they can cause some problems as well. We will explore one of the ways that floating point numbers can cause problems in a spreadsheet now.</p>
       <p>The first step is to fill out the floating point section of your worksheet, so you can understand how continuous numbers are represented in a floating point format. 
         You'll see that the approach is similar, but not identical, to scientific notation.</p>
       <p>Next, you should understand that floating point representations of continuous numbers are not perfect, and floating point math is responsible for some decidedly 
         strange behavior in Excel. We will be relying on Excel to do some very complex analysis tasks for us, yet it's possible to make Excel fail in calculations that we can do 
         in our heads, thanks to built-in limitations of representing continuous base 10 decimal numbers digitally.</p>
       <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">1. Start excel, and in cell A1 enter "Series". In cell A2 enter 0.01, and in cell A3 enter 0.0099 - cell A3 is thus 0.0001 less than cell A2.</p>
       <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">2. Select cells A2 and A3 and use the fill handle to extend the series to cell A110. Since cell A3 is 0.0001 less than A2, this will create a series in 
         which each cell is 0.0001 less than the one before.</p><p><input name="Checkbox1"
type="checkbox">3. Now look at cell A102 - if you did it right you will see the number 6.07E-17. 
         Computers represent scientific notation this way, so E-17 meaning "10<sup>-17</sup>". The cell before, A101, is showing 0.0001, so subtracting 0.0001 from that 
         should be...what? One of the first things you learn about subtraction is that any number subtracted from itself is 0, right? You've probably known that since 
         first grade, and can figure it out in your head. But Excel, for all its sophistication, thinks that 0.0001 - 0.0001 is 6.07 x 10<sup>-17</sup> (a very small 
         number, granted, but not 0). The next cell is formatted as -1E-04 (which is -0.0001 in scientific notation), so aside from sticking with scientific notation Excel 
         seems to come to its senses after one glitch.</p><p>So, what happened? In cell B102 enter the formula <span
class="Excel">=0.0001 - 0.0001</span>, and you'll see that 
         the answer is 0 (we'll learn about cell formulas later, but for now all you need to know is that using an = tells Excel to do a calculation). Obviously, Excel does 
         know that a number subtracted from itself is 0. Why can it get it right if we do the calculation like this, but wrong if we do the calculation as a series?</p>
         <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">4. To see what's going on, make column A wider, select cells A2 through A101, and then increase the number of decimals displayed by clicking on the 
         "Increase Decimal" button, <img alt="Increase decimal" src="incr_decimal.png">, until you can see all 15 of the significant digits. You'll see that 
         although Excel is only displaying the first four decimal places by default, starting in cell A10 the actual value stored has a digit at the 17th decimal place that should be 0 but isn't. </p>
         <p>When Excel makes a series, it starts with the two numbers you selected and subtracts the first from the second to decide how much difference there is between cells, and then when it 
         calculates the next number in the series it adds that difference to the last filled in cell. To see how much difference Excel thinks there is between the first two cells, in cell B3 
         enter <span class="Excel">=A3-A2</span>, and then increase the decimals, and you'll see that Excel thinks that there is a difference of -0.0000999999999999994 between 0.01 and 0.0099, instead of -0.0001 - this is a 
         small error numerically speaking (0.0000000000000000006 is only 0.0000000000006% of the actual difference, which is a small amount of error). Of course, considering how simple the 
         calculation is you might find it surprising that there is any error at all, but at least it's just a small error.</p>
         <p>But, bear in mind that as the value of -0.0000999999999999994 is added to each cell to calculate the next in the series this small error accumulates. Because Excel knows that 
         floating point math causes small errors like this it notices that there is a long string of 0's before the final non-zero digits, and it rounds the display to the fourth decimal 
         place (it doesn't change the cell value, but it does change the display to show you what you expect to see). </p>
         <p>The reason you finally see the error in cell A102 is that all the digits in the first four decimal places go to 0 in cell A102, and all that's left to display are the digits 
         that were added due to the floating point math errors at the 16th decimal place and beyond, so those are displayed.</p>
         <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">5. Does this matter? Most of the time such a tiny numerical error wouldn't cause problems, but sometimes it does. For example, in cell B100 enter the formula <span
class="Excel">=0.0002/A100</span> - 
         this formula divides 0.0002 by the value in cell A100, which is also supposed to be 0.0002, and displays the result as 1. If you increase the decimal places you'll see the value is 
         actually 0.9999999999997, but the error of 0.0000000000003 is tiny and Excel rounds to the correct value of 1.</p>
         <p>But, if you copy cell B100 and paste it to cells B101 and B102 you will get the result of dividing 0.0002 by the numbers in cell A101 and A102 respectively. You'll see that 
         everything is still okay for cell B101 (you are dividing 0.0002 by a number that is supposed to be 0.0001, and you get a value very close to 2 as a result), but in cell B102 you 
         get a massive number of 3294061441733.85. This is because in cell B102 you are dividing 0.0002 by the tiny number in cell A102, instead of dividing by the 0 that is supposed to 
         be there. Dividing by 0 should result in an error, since dividing by 0 is undefined mathematically, but instead you get a huge number. If you were writing a program that relied 
         on dividing one floating point number by another you may think to check whether you were dividing by 0 and protect against this error in your program, but you may not think 
         to check whether you were dividing by a tiny number that is supposed to be 0, and you could end up producing answers that are wildly off. These sorts of floating point 
         arithmetic errors can cause problems in the real world (<a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/users/vuik/wi211/disasters.html">rockets blowing up</a>, for example).</p>
         <p>It may seem like the purpose of teaching you this is to make you less trusting of computers, but that's not really the goal - most of the time these sorts of errors are 
          so small as to be safely ignored. The real take-home message is this: YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ANALYSIS! Computers are amazingly useful tools, but converting our base 
          10, analog world into a computer's base 2 digital world doesn't work perfectly, and even seemingly simple operations can lead to surprising results 
          if you aren't aware of a computer's limitations.</p>
      <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">C. <strong>Translate letters to ASCII decimal codes, and then to
          binary</strong>. Use the table <a href="http://www.ascii-code.com/">here</a>
        for the translation to decimal codes (the first column, labeled DEC).</p>
      <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">D. <strong>Translate colors between colors and RGB codes</strong>.
        Remember that in 24 bit ("true") color, each channel is an 8 bit whole
        number, between 0 and 255, and interpreted as light intensity in that channel. So, for example, a value of 0,0,0 means no red, no green,
        and no blue light - no light of any kind gives us black. Maximum values
        of 255, 255, 255 means a maximum intensity of light of all three
        wavelengths, which gives us white.</p>

   <h2 class="part" id="lossy_compression">File storage and lossy compression</h2>
		<p>Digital files can get really big, and although storage media capacities keep increasing we keep finding ways to fill them up. Finding ways to store information with fewer bits allows us to 
      fit more data onto our hard drives, CD-ROM's, and flash drives.</p>
     <p>When you are looking at pictures on a web page, or watching video, or listening to music, as long as everything looks and sounds okay to you there would be no reason to worry about whether 
       the images or audio were exactly as they were recorded. If the recorded data had been changed in some way to save storage space, as long as the results didn't look or sound different it wouldn't matter.</p>
     <p>When you ware doing scientific work, though, digital data in image, sound, or video files is used to measure the properties of a system being studied. A change in data that isn't intentional is a problem, 
       and the fact that the change may not be noticeable to the researcher actually makes the problem worse, as the data may be used as though it's accurate when it isn't anymore.</p><p>Using lossy file formats is a 
       way of corrupting your digital data unintentionally, and possibly without knowing that you did so. Today you will evaluate how use of lossy file formats can affect digital sound data and digital image data. 
       In general, use of lossy file formats in scientific work is a bad idea, and should only be done when a researcher knows how the data will be altered, and is certain that the change will not affect his or her work.</p>
      <p><strong class="part" id="lossy_audio">Lossy compression of audio files</strong></p>
<p>Lossy compression methods commonly used for sound files throw out sounds that aren't audible to the human ear. This is fine for audio recordings that are meant for entertainment, but if we are 
  recording animal sounds to study how they communicate we have to be aware that animals can hear different ranges of sound than we can, and throwing out data because we can't hear it is problematic.</p>
<p><img alt="Blackbird" src="Common_Blackbird.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px;">To see how lossy compression affects sound files, we are going to use a program called Audacity to analyze a 
  recording of a European Blackbird. European Blackbirds are not closely related to blackbirds we have in North America, they are actually much more closely related to the American Robin. 
  If you know birds, the picture of a European Blackbird to the left looks just like a black robin.</p>
<p>We are not going to spend a lot of time on analyzing the structure of Blackbird song today, but we will evaluate how use of a sound file format that uses lossy compression affects the data in a recording.</p>
<p>We will use a program called Audacity to assess the loss of data in sound files. We will start with a recording of a blackbird song in an uncompressed WAV file, export it to a lossy compression 
  format (called Ogg Vorbis), and then compare the compressed file to the original.</p><p
style="clear: both"><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">1. Start Audacity from Cougar Apps. You can open a copy of the uncompressed WAV file by navigating to the "Computer" 
  icon, and then to "Public on Viking (P:)" â†’ "Biology" â†’ "kristanw" â†’ "Biol365" â†’ "Ex2", and then open the file "blackbird_w.wav". You will get a warning message about importing uncompressed audio, 
  with a suggestion to make a copy of the files before editing; say "OK" to this.</p>
<p>When it opens, the sound file is displayed as a waveform graph, which has time on the x-axis, and loudness (in decibels) on the y-axis. If you play the sound, you'll hear that the blackbird has a lilting, 
  flute-like song that covers a wide range of different pitches - this will make it a good test case.</p>
<p><img alt="Inverted" src="sound_inverted.png" style="float: left; padding: 10px; width: 218px; height: 180px;"><input
name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">2. Before we try out some lossy compression, we will test the method we will use to compare 
  the original sound file to the compressed one. We will make a copy of the original uncompressed WAV file, invert it, and then mix the original with the inverted copy. An example of a tiny clip from the 
  sound file is shown to the left, with the original on top and the inverted original on the bottom - inverting the sound file flips the wave vertically around 0, so that positive values become negative, 
  and negative become positive. </p>
<p>Mixing these two sound waves together means to add them, and if two waves are exact inverses of one another they will cancel each other out. The result will be a flat line at 0, which is silence.</p>
<p style="clear: both;">First we'll make an exact copy of the song by selecting "Edit" â†’ "Duplicate" - you will now see a second copy of the original in a second "track". below the first.</p>
<p>Next, select just the duplicate track by clicking into the box at the left of the second track, like so <img
alt="Select track" src="audacity_select_track.png">. Don't click on any of the buttons or 
  settings, just click into the area that says "Mono, 11025Hz" and "32-bit float". When a track is selected it darkens, so the second track should be darker than the first.</p>
<p>Now, select "Effect" â†’ "Invert". If you watch the waveform graph as you invert it you'll see a subtle change in the wave form, but otherwise you probably won't be able to tell that it's different. Don't worry if you don't see the change - you can double-check that it happened by checking the "Edit" menu, and if it gives you the option to undo the invert then you're good to go.</p><p>To mix the tracks together both have to be selected, so hold down the SHIFT key while you select the original track. At this point both tracks should be darkened. Select "Tracks" â†’ "Mix and render to new track". The two tracks will be combined into one, and you'll see a flat line. If you select this new mixed track and play it you won't hear anything. This is what happens when two tracks are identical.</p><p>Before you move on to the next step you can close the second, duplicate track by clicking the little x next to the name of the track in the properties box on the left side of the track (next to "blackbird_" in the screen shot above), and do the same for the mixed flat line track.</p><p><input
name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">3. Now select "File" â†’ "Export Audio". In the "Export Audio" window that pops up:</p><ul><li>Navigate to your H: drive, and select "Ogg Vorbis Files" as the "Save as type:".</li><li>Leave the quality at 5. The quality setting is a trade-off between file size (smaller with lower quality setting) and degree of change to the sound data (more change with lower quality). We'll see how accepting the default setting works out.</li><li>Change the file name to "lossy_blackbird_w.ogg" and save.</li></ul><p>You may not have heard of Ogg Vorbis before - it is a lossy sound file format intended for the same uses as mp3 files, primarily for sound files meant for human ears. We would have used mp3 since it is so common, but there is a bug in the mp3 encoder used by Audacity that inserts a few milliseconds of silence at the beginning of each file, and this causes the sound waves to mis-align when we try to compare them. However, any lossy sound file format, including mp3, would change the sound data and give us similar results to what we will get with Ogg Vorbis.</p><p><input
name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">4. Import the lossy version of the file as a second track. Select "File" â†’ "Import" â†’ "Audio", and go find the Ogg Vorbis file you just exported, select it, and import it.</p><p>Audacity will make a new track for this file. The wave forms don't obviously look different, and if you select the lossy one and play it you won't be notice any obvious differences.</p><p><input
name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">5. Now, to compare the two waves:</p><ul><li>Select the lossy track, and invert it.</li><li>Select both tracks, and mix and render them to a new track.</li></ul><p>You should now have a mixed track that isn't a flat line. Anywhere that isn't flat is a part of the recording in which saving to a lossy format changed the data.</p><p>If you try to play the mixed track you may not hear much, it's a fairly subtle amount of difference. But, it's not zero difference, and for scientific work it is a bad idea to allow a choice of file format to change your data.</p><p><strong
class="part" id="lossy_images">Lossy and lossless compression - images</strong></p>
<p>Some image file formats are uncompressed (e.g. TIFF), but there are also lossless (e.g. PNG), and lossy compression (e.g. JPEG) formats to choose from. </p>
<p>Just like with sound file compression, lossy compression of images discards image data strategically, so that the image still looks okay when viewed at its intended magnification. However, 
  when images are being used as a data collection method, these changes in the image corrupt the data.</p>
<p>We need to use an image editing program for this, so we will use the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). The GIMP is an open source program that is similar to PhotoShop.</p>
<p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">1. Start the GIMP from Cougar Apps, and open the original TIFF file on the P: drive. You will find it in the same folder as the blackbird song - it's called csusm.tif.</p>
<p>When you open it you'll see it's a high resolution aerial photo of part of the CSUSM campus taken in 2012 (before the USU was built, although you can see that construction had started).</p>
<p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">2. Hold down the SHIFT key and hit + to zoom in. When you've zoomed in far enough to see individual pixels stop. This image has a resolution if 0.6 feet, so each pixel is equivalent to 
  0.36 square feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Select "Windows" â†’ "Dockable Dialogs" â†’ "Pointer" to bring up the pointer window. With the pointer window visible, move your pointer around the image and you'll see that the Red, Green, and 
  Blue values change as you move from pixel to pixel. Even though some pixels are pretty similar in color, you will have a hard time finding RGB values that are identical for adjacent pixels.</p>
<p>You can zoom back out so that you can see the whole scene now by hitting the "-" key (to the left of +).</p>
<p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">3. Now it's time to export the file as a lossy file format, jpeg. We're going to use jpeg because it is so common, to the point that many digital cameras use it as their native format. 
  The amount of compression is configurable as a "quality" setting - higher quality means less compression, and if a quality setting of 100% is used then only lossless compression is used. 
  However, even digital cameras will typically use a quality setting less than 100% by default, and some degree of lossy compression is typically used when the image is originally acquired.</p>
<p>Choose "File" â†’ "Export as", and in the "Export Image" window give the file the name "csusm.jpg" and save it to your H: drive. Using the jpg extension will cause the GIMP to export as a jpeg file. We will accept the default of 90%, so don't change this setting.</p>
<p>When you click "Export" an "Export image as JPEG" window will pop up so that you can set the quality. The default is 90%, which is considered very high (70% is considered high quality for images 
  used on web pages). Click "Export".</p>
<p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">4. Import the jpeg file as a layer by selecting "File" â†’ "Open as layers". Navigate to the csusm.jpg, select and open it.</p>
<p>This will add csusm.jpg as a second layer in the same image as csusm.tif, rather than opening the jpeg file as a separate image. If you look at the "Layers-Brushes" window you'll see that you 
  now have a layer for csusm.jpg above the original csusm.tif layer.</p>
<p>You can turn the csusm.jpg layer on and off by clicking on the eye icon, but you probably won't notice big differences unless 
  you zoom in to pixel level, and even at a very high magnification the differences are very slight.</p>
<p>But there are in fact small differences throughout the image. We will confirm that in the next step.</p>
<p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">5. To do the comparison of csusm.tif and csusm.jpg we will take advantage of a built-in function that is used to make animations from multiple images. Animations and video take up a lot of file space 
  because they use multiple images that are played in quick succession to give the illusion of movement. If each frame in the animation is a complete, separate image, then the animation file size will be the 
  size of a single frame multiplied by the number of frames. Animations and video files get big quickly if they are not compressed.</p>
<p>However, it is often the case that different frames in an animation have a lot of pixels that are identical, and only a few pixels that change between frames. If the animation file contains a full 
  image for the first frame, and then saves only the differences between the first frame and the frames that follow, pixels that don't change only have to be saved once, which can save a lot of space. 
  We will use a tool that makes these differenced images for the purposes of making animations, so that we can see where the differences lie between the tif and jpeg layers.</p>
<p>Select "Filters" â†’ "Animation" â†’ "Optimize (difference)". This will make a new image in a new window with two layers, the first being a complete copy of the original lossless tif image, 
  and the second being pixels in the jpeg that are different from the original tif. Pixels that are the same between the tif and jpeg images are transparent in the second layer, so turning the original 
  on and off by clicking the eye icon next to csusm.tif(100ms) will show where the differences are - any pixel that isn't transparent is different between the tif and jpeg layers.</p>
<p>You can make the differences even clearer by:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>In the "Toolbox - Tool Options" window click on the black box, <img
alt="Foreground" src="foreground.png">, and set the foreground color to a nice bright red.</li>
         <li>In the "Layers" window, right-click to get a context menu, and then select "New layer" to create a new, blank layer. In the "New Layer" settings window that pops up, set "Layer Fill Type" to "Foreground color" (which you just set to red), and click "OK"</li>
         <li>The new layer is on top, and is blocking the other layers in the image - drag the new layer below csusm.tif(100ms)</li>
       </ul>
<p>Now when you turn csusm.tif(100ms) off you will see red through the transparent pixels - red pixels are those that did not change when you saved the original tif image as a jpeg with 90% quality. Any pixel that is not red is at least a little different from the tif image.</p>
<p>Since most of the image isn't red, there were at least small changes to most of the pixels in the image when it was saved as a jpeg. The differences are mostly very slight, but just like with 
  the audio file, we wouldn't want choice of file format to change our data at all, so non-zero changes are a problem.</p>
<p>In general, the best way to avoid corruption to your digital data is to use either uncompressed file formats, or file formats that use lossless compression.</p>
<p>That's it! Upload your completed Excel file to the course web site, and complete your worksheet to turn in next week.</p>
