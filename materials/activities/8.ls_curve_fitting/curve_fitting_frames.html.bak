      <p> Today you will learn how to fit data to non-linear functions using least squares, obtain estimates of the
        function's coefficients, calculate standard errors of the estimates, and test whether two parameter estimates
        are statistically significantly different.</p>

                photosynthesis data used as an example in lecture. Net photosynthesis can be measured at varying light
                levels by a portable photosynthesis system like the one pictured to the left. A leaf is placed in the
                machine's chamber, and light levels are set by the machine. The rate of depletion of CO<sub>2</sub> from
                the chamber is a measure of carbon fixation through photosynthesis, so the data produced by the system
                is a set of light levels and photosynthesis rates. Thus, both light level and net photosynthesis are
                known quantities.</p>

                is not a straight line, as you can see from the graph of a typical photosynthesis curve shown to the
                left. Photosynthesis rises quickly as light levels rise, then asymptotically approach a maximum. If all
                of the conditions needed for photosynthesis are met or exceeded, the curve will plateau when the
                photosynthetically active tissue is fixing carbon as quickly as it possibly can. Photosynthesis is
                limited by light availability at low light levels, which causes the curve to drop rapidly below a value
                of about 500.</p>

              <p>Many trees grow in dense forests, such that the leaves at the top of the tree are the only ones that
                routinely receive direct sunlight without being shaded by neighboring trees. Leaves near the base may be
                in the shadow of their neighbors most or all of the day. A tree may respond to this by producing leaves
                with different structures at the top and bottom of the tree to take full advantage of the light that's
                available. Leaves from the top of a tree will generally not be light limited, but being in the sun all
                day makes evaporation rates go up. Leaves from the bottom of the tree need to make efficient use of the
                light available, but will be in a cooler, more shaded environment that will expose them to lower rates
                of water loss. Since leaves at the top and leaves at the bottom face different environments, they may
                show differences in their photosynthetic activity.</p>

              <p> From the graph to the left it's clear that when tested at consistent, known light levels by the
                machine, leaves from the tree top have higher net photosynthesis than leaves from the base of the tree
                when light levels are high. However, below about 500 on the x-axis this changes - leaves from the bottom
                are more effective at photosynthesizing when light levels are low. </p>
              <p>It would be nice to be able to take this interpretation further, and try to understand why the curves

      <p> To do this, we will need to pick an equation that relates net photosynthesis to light levels, and that has
        parameters that are interpretable as different characteristics of the photosynthesis process. We will then be
        able to use differences in the parameters from each curve to better understand what is causing differences in
        shape of the curves. An equation that relates photosynthesis to light levels is the following:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <img src="equation.jpg" alt="Equation" style="width: 670px; height: 88px;"></p>
      <p> The definition of the terms in this equation are:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Q = light intensity (the independent variable, set by the photosynthesis system)</p>
      <p> Pnet = net photosynthesis (the response variable, measured by the photosynthesis system)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Φ = upper-case Greek Phi = maximum quantum yield (measure of efficiency of conversion from light energy to
        chemical energy)</p>
      <p> θ = upper-case Greek Theta = Convexity of the curve (a dimensionless constant)</p>
      <p> P<sub>marea</sub> = maximum area-based rate of net photosynthesis (CO<sub>2</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> per s)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> We will fit one data set for leaves at the bottom of a tree to this curve. For comparison, I have provided you
        with a completed analysis of data from leaves at the top of a tree as well, so you can see how they differ in
        their parameters.</p>

      <p>You'll see that you have two worksheets, one with data from a leaf at the bottom of a tree, and one from a leaf
        at the top of the same tree. The one from the top of the tree is already done, and as you complete the analysis
        of the data of the leaf from the bottom of the tree it will be automatically added to the graph on the "Top"

          <p>Theta controls the convexity. Try out values of theta in cell b18 that bring the Pnet predicted values as

      <p> </p>
      <p> You'll see that the parameters are now a little different than before, and the curve goes nicely through the
        data in the graph.</p>
      <p>Now is a good time to save your work!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="std_errors"> Calculate standard errors</h2>
      <p>If you switch to the "Top" sheet for a moment, you'll see that the estimates you obtained for bottom leaves are
        already plotted on a graph, along with estimates based on measurements from top leaves. The two curves are not
        identical, and we can use the differences in each parameter to better understand why the curves differ. </p>
      <p>However, our estimates of parameters are based on a sample of data, and if we had picked different leaves we
        probably would have gotten somewhat different results. The differences between parameters for top and bottom
        leaves may just reflect this random sampling variation, rather than being due to a real difference. Before we
        try to interpret the differences between the top and bottom leaves we should test whether the differences we see
        are big enough to be considered real, and not just random sampling variation. We can quantify how much random
        sampling variation to expect in each parameter estimate by calculating their standard errors. </p>
      <p>As we learned in today's lecture, if we are wrong about the value of one of the parameters, then our predicted
        values will be wrong by some amount. The function we are using, though, isn't equally sensitive to changes in
        each of the parameters. If changing a parameter by a little causes a big change in predicted value, then the
        function has high sensitivity to the parameter. If changing a parameter by a lot has very little effect on
        predicted values, then the function has low sensitivity to the parameter. This has implications for how good
        each of our parameter estimates is - we'll get better estimates, with smaller standard errors, for parameters
        that the function is sensitive to, and poorer estimates, with larger standard errors, for parameter the function
        is not sensitive to. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> We are going to take advantage of the sensitivity of the function to change in its parameters when we
        calculate standard errors, using a method called "finite difference approximation". This involves altering each
        of the estimated parameter values one at a time by a very small amount, then seeing how much change in predicted
        value we get (the "deltas"). We can then use the difference in the predicted values per unit change in the
        parameters to calculate P, which is a matrix of sums of squares and cross products for the deltas. We will then
        use the inverted P matrix, along with an estimate of the standard error of model overall (based on the
        residuals), to calculate the standard errors for each of the three parameters we estimated. This requires
        several steps.</p>

        in Y divided by the change in the Phi parameter, and since we haven't changed Phi yet both the numerator and
        denominator are 0, which is where the divide by zero error comes from. This will go away when we change phi. </p>

        off diagonal. These are approximations to first partial derivatives, which are instantaneous values - that is,
        they represent the change in Y with an infinitely small change in one of the parameters. Our change wasn't
        infinitely small, but it was sufficiently small that our approximation should be very good. All we need to do to
        get our P matrix is to transpose the deltas, then multiply the transposed delta matrix by the untransposed delta
        matrix. We can then invert P, which will give us the numbers needed to calculate standard errors of our
        parameters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step3.2a" type="checkbox">a. Copy the dY's in f1:h9, and paste-special transposed into cell j1 -
        that is, select cell j1, right-click, and select this paste option: <img src="transpose.png" alt="Transpose">.
        You should now have a copy of the dY's with the columns converted to rows.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step3.2b" type="checkbox">b. Next you will matrix multiply the transposed dY matrix by the dY
        matrix get the sums of squares and cross-products matrix, P. In cell F12 type "P matrix". Since we're
        calculating these values for three parameters the result of this multiplication will be a new 3x3 matrix, so we
        need to select a 3x3 range of cells - select cells F13:H15. With the cells selected, type <span class="Excel">=mmult(k1:r3,
          f2:h9)</span>. Remember to CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. The result will be sums of squares and cross-products for the
        deviations we calculated in F2 through H9.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step3.2c" type="checkbox">c. Invert the matrix. In cell F17 type "Inverted P". Select cells
        F18:H20, and type <span class="Excel">=minverse(f13:h15)</span>, and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This will give you the
        inverse of the P matrix.</p>

      <p><strong> <input name="step4.2" type="checkbox">Step 4 - Calculate the standard error of residuals for the
          best-fit model.</strong></p>
      <p>Before we can use the inverted P matrix to calculate standard errors, we need the standard error of the model
        overall, which is calculated from the sum of squared residuals. Once we have this we will use it, along with
        some of the elements of the inverted P, to calculate standard errors of each of the parameters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step4.2a" type="checkbox">a. In cell B12 type "SE", and in cell C12 type <span class="Excel">=sqrt(c11/(8-3))</span>.
        This is the formula for the standard error of light level, based on the sum of squared deviations in c11, and
        our model degrees of freedom. We have 8 light levels (n = 8), and are estimating three parameters, so the
        degrees of freedom are 8-3 = 5.</p>

      <p> <strong><input name="step5.2" type="checkbox">Step 5 - Calculate the standard errors of the parameter

      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step5.2a" type="checkbox">a. In cell C22 type "SE". In cell C23 type <span class="Excel">=c12*sqrt(f18)</span>.
        This multiplies the standard error of Y we just calculated by the square root of the entry in the inverted P
        matrix that corresponds to the Phi parameter. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step5.2b" type="checkbox">b. In cell C24 type <span class="Excel">=c12*sqrt(g19)</span>. This
        is the standard error for Pmarea.</p>

      <p> <input name="step5.2c" type="checkbox">c. In cell C25 type <span class="Excel">=c12*sqrt(h20)</span>. This
        is the standard error for Theta.</p>

      <p><strong> <input name="ANiceCheckbox" type="checkbox">Step 6 - compare top leaves to bottom leaves.</strong></p>
      <p>If you switch back to the "Top" sheet, you'll see that this entire analysis has been done for you in the "Top
        and Bottom Compared" area. If you put everything in the right place in the Bottom sheet, you should see the
        following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The graph shows both lines plotted.</li>
        <li>The parameter estimates for Bottom leaves in cells L18, L19, and L20 of the Top sheet should match the
          estimates in the Bottom sheet.</li>
        <li>The SE's for the bottom leaf parameters should be in cells L24, L25, and L26 of the Top sheet, and should
          match the standard errors you calculated in the Top sheet.</li>
        <li>There should be t-values and p-values for comparisons of bottom and top leaves for each parameter in
          M24-N26.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each t-value is the difference between the parameter estimates divided by a pooled standard error. P-values
        come from comparing the observed t-value to a t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom (5 for each leaf).
        Consider the parameters for top and bottom leaves to be different if the p-values are less than 0.05.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
      <p>In addition to the completed Bottom worksheet, starting in cell J28 of the Top sheet answer the following
        questions:</p>
      <p>a. Which kind of leaves (top or bottom) had a higher Pmarea? Does the graph reflect this difference between the
        leaf types? Explain how you know.</p>
      <p>b. Which leaf type (top or bottom) had the highest quantum yield (phi)? What does this tell you about which
        type of leaf needs to be more efficient in using light?</p>
      <p>c. How do these two different parameters translate into the net photosynthesis differences you see in the
        graph? Specifically, which kind of leaf has higher photosynthesis at low light levels (light = 50, 100, 250)?
        Which kind of leaf has higher photosynthesis at high light levels (light = 500 or higher)? Why do leaves from
        the top of the tree have less efficiency in their use of light, but still end up having the highest net
        photosynthesis at high light levels?</p>
