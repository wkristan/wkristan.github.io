    <p>
      Today you will learn how to fit data to functions, obtain estimates of
      coefficients, calculate standard errors of the estimates, and test
      their statistical significance.</p>

        align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">We
      will use the same kind of photosynthesis data used as an example in
      lecture. Net photosynthesis can be measured at varying light levels by
      a portable photosynthesis system like the one pictured to the left. A leaf
      is placed in the machine's
      chamber, and light levels are set by the machine. The rate of depletion
      of CO2 from the chamber is a measure of carbon fixation through
      photosynthesis.</p>

        alt="Curve" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">Net photosynthesis and
      light level are both
      known quantities - light level is set by the system, making it the
      independent variable, and net photosynthesis is measured in response.
      However, the shape of the response between these two variables is not a
      straight line, as you can see from the graph of a typical photosynthesis
      curve shown to the left.
      Photosynthesis rises quickly as light levels rise, then asymptotically
      approach a maximum. If all of the conditions needed for photosynthesis
      are met or exceeded, the curve will plateau when the photosynthetically
      active tissue is fixing carbon as quickly as it possibly can. However,
      if there is insufficient water, or if gas exchange is impeded, or some
      other necessary condition for maximum photosynthetic rate is not met,
      then the plateau will be lower than it could theoretically be.</p>

      <img style="width: 357px; height: 245px;" alt="Compare top to bottom" src="compare_top_bottom.jpg"
        align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">Many
      trees grow in dense forests, such that the leaves at the top of
      the tree are the only ones that routinely receive direct sunlight.
      Leaves near the base may be in shadow most or all of the day. A tree
      may respond to this by changing the leaf in ways that take full
      advantage of the light available. If we were interested in whether
      leaves at the tops of
      trees had different photosynthesis curves from trees near the base, we
      could compare the data from leaves taken at the top and bottom of the
      tree. If we did this, we may find
      something like the graph to the left.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this graph it's clear that leaves at the top have higher net
      photosynthesis than leaves at the base of the tree when light levels
      are high, but they don't seem to be as effective at photosynthesizing
      when light levels are low. It would be nice to be able to take this
      interpretation further, and try to understand why the curves differ in
      the way that they do. To do this, we will need to pick an equation that
      relates net photosynthesis to light levels, and that has parameters
      that are interpretable as different characteristics of photosynthesis.
      We will then be able to use differences in the parameters from each
      curve to better understand what is causing the differences in shape of
      the curves.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      An equation that relates photosynthesis to light levels is the
      following:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img style="width: 670px; height: 88px;" alt="Equation" src="equation.jpg"></p>
    <p>
      The definition of the terms in this equation are:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Q = light intensity (the independent variable, set by the
      photosynthesis system)</p>
    <p>
      Pnet = net photosynthesis (the response variable, measured by the
      photosynthesis system)</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Φ
      = upper-case Greek Phi = maximum quantum yield (i.e. maximum fixation of
      CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>
    <p>
      θ
      = upper-case Greek Theta = Convexity of the curve (a dimensionless
      constant)</p>
    <p>
      P<sub>marea</sub> = maximum area-based rate of net photosynthesis (CO<sub>2</sub>
      per m<sup>2</sup> per s)</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will fit one data set for leaves at the bottom of a tree to this
      curve. For comparison, I have provided you with a completed analysis of
      data from leaves at the top of a tree
      as well, so you can see how they differ in their parameters.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Fit the curve to the data to obtain estimates of Φ, θ, and P<sub>marea</sub></h2>
    <p>
      1. Download <a href="curve_fit_data.xls">this</a> file, and save
      it to
      the folder H:/Biol396/ex7. You'll see that you have two worksheets, one
      with data from a leaf at the bottom of a tree, and one from a leaf at
      the top of the same tree. The one from the top of the tree is already
      done, and as you complete the analysis of the data of the leaf from the
      boddom of the tree it will be automatically added to the graph on the
      "Top" worksheet. Aside from the block of cells in the "Top and Bottom
      Compared" region, and the graph, the Bottom sheet will look just like
      the Top sheet when you're done. You can refer to the Top sheet as an
      example as you're working through the exercise.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Set up the "Bottom" sheet for curve fitting. In cell A15 type
      "Parameter", and in B15 type "Values". </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Select A16, switch to the "Insert" tab, and click on "Symbol". On the
      Symbol selector that pops up, select "Greek and Coptic" as the
      "Subset", and find <a href="insert_phi.jpeg">capital Phi</a> - select it,
      and click "Insert".</p>
    <p>
      Select cell A17 and type "Pmarea". </p>
    <p>Select cell A18 and insert lower case <a href="insert_theta.jpeg">theta</a>,
      using the "Insert" "Symbol" method you used for Phi.</p>
    <p>
      We will need to provide starting values for these parameters, but for
      now just type in 1's for each parameter (1 for B16, B17, and B18).</p>
    <p>
      We will be typing in a fairly complicated formula next, so to make this
      easier we are going to assign names to each of the parameters we can
      refer to in the formula, rather than using absolute cell references. </p>
    <p>Click on cell B16 (the Phi parameter), and right-click. In the menu
      that pops up, select "Define name...". In the "New name" window that
      pops up, the "Name" will already show the greek Phi symbol - this looks
      like it would be ideal, but we want to use something that's easy to
      enter into a formula, and don't want to have to do to the symbol
      selector each time we want to use this parameter. Change the Phi symbol
      to the "phi", change the "Scope" to "Bottom" (that is, just use this
      name in the Bottom worksheet) and click "OK". </p>
    <p>Select cell B17,
      right-click, and name the range "Pmarea". </p>
    <p>Right-click on B18,
      and name the range "theta".</p>
    <p>Finally, we will also need to specify the standard deviation for the
      residuals around the line. In cell A20 type "s", and in B20 type in 2.
      Leave the row 19 blank - the standard deviation is important to our
      maximum likelihood estimate, but it's not part of the model.</p>
    <p>
      3. Calculate predicted Pnet. In cell C1 type "Pnet predicted", and in
      cell C2 enter the formula that predicts Pnet above. You will need to
      type in:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      =(phi*A2+Pmarea-SQRT((phi*A2+Pmarea)^2 - 4*theta*phi*A2*Pmarea))/(2*theta)</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that since we named the cell ranges containing our parameters we
      can refer to them by name, rather than by absolute cell reference. This
      makes complex formulas much easier to read, and much easier to
      trouble-shoot if you make a mistake. The only cell reference in the
      formula is A2, which points to the first light level.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Copy and paste this cell to the rest of the data rows, C3 to C9.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Graph the data. At this point we want to pick better starting values
      for our parameters so that the predicted values come as close as we can
      to the observed values - we will let Solver find the best values, but
      the closer we are when we start the more reliable the results will be.
      Select cells A1 through C9, and insert a scatter plot with only
      markers. Then, select the predicted Pnet series, right-click, and
      select "Format data series" from the popup menu. For "Line Style" set
      the width to 1 pt, and for "Marker Options" use "None" - this will make
      the predicted values show only as a line on the graph.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Add axis labels - use "Light" as the x-axis label, and "Pnet" as the
      y-axis label.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your graph should look like <a href="fit_bad_start.jpeg">this</a>. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter that sets the level at which the curve plateaus is the
      Pmarea. Pick the Pnet at which the curve flattens and enter it in B16
      as a starting value. Your point should now be close to the curve where
      it flattens.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantum yield (Phi) and convexity (theta) control the curvature of the
      graph. Typical values of Phi are around 0.025, so enter this in B16.
      Convexity will be less than 1, so to begin enter 0.7 into B18.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The curve is going through the data pretty well at this point, and you
      shouldn't have any problems reaching a solution.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Calculate the residuals between Pnet and predicted
      Pnet. In cell D1 type "Residuals", and in D2 type =b2-c2. Always use
      observed minus expected rather than the other way around.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste the formula from D2 to D3 to D9.</p>
    <p>6. Calculate the likelihoods of the observations, and of the overall
      model. In cell E1 write " '- Log likelihood" (notice the single quote
      before the negative - you need this or Excel thinks you are writing a
      formula and helpfully converts your label to a formula, and then helpfully
      gives you an error). </p>
    <p>In cell E2 write =-ln(normdist(d2,c2,b$20,0)). </p>
    <p>nordist() is the Excel function for probabilities from the normal curve.
      The first argument is the value we are calculating the probability for,
      which is the deviation between the observed and expected values. The
      second argument is the mean, for which we will used the predicted values
      (predicted values on a line are the averages expected at that position
      along the x-axis). The third argument is the standard deviation we
      selected for the deviations - this will change as we do our curve.
      Finally, the last argument is a "logical" that tells the formula that we
      don't want a cumulative probability from negative infinity to our first
      argument, we want the probability density at that point. The ln() function
      takes the natural log, and the negative sign before ln() gives us the
      negative.</p>
    <p>Now, copy and paste this to the rest of the rows.</p>
    <p>Finally, in cell D11 write "Sum of -LogLikelihood", and in E11 write =
      sum(e2:e9). This is the value we will minimize in order to get our maximum
      likelihood estimates for the parameters.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Use Solver to find the parameter estimates. Maximum likelihood
      estimates are usually based on an iterative, numerical solution rather
      than calculating them directly from equations. The Solver is Excel's tool
      for finding iterative, numerical solutions.</p>
    <p>Switch to the "Data" tab, and you should see the Solver on the right side
      of the toolbar. If it isn't there, you can turn it on by selecting "File"
      -&gt; "Options", and then clicking on the "Add-ins" item in the Excel
      Options window. At the bottom of the window is a "Manage: Excel Add-ins" item
      with a "Go..." button next to it. Click the "Go..." button, and check the
      box next to "Solver Add-in", and click "OK". The Solver item should be in
      the Data tab now. </p>
    <p>Click on Solver, and have it set
      cell E11 (the -Log Likelihood of the model given the data) to Min by
      changing cells
      B16:B18 (the parameters) and B20 (the standard deviation for the
      residuals). You can click the "zoom box" to the right of the "By Changing
      Variable Cells" area, and select the cells by clicking on them. We can
      also add a couple of "constraints" to prevent Solver from attempting
      numbers that are impossible (like negatives). Click on "Add" to add
      constraints, then click on each parameter one at a time and make them
      &gt;= 0 (that is, non-negative). When you're done, click "Solve".</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll see that the parameters are now a little different than before, and
      the curve goes nicely through the data in the graph.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Calculate standard errors</h2>
    <p>
      Standard errors are measures of sampling precision. Our estimates of
      parameters are based on a sample of data, and if we had picked a
      different leaf we probably would have gotten somewhat different
      results. This random sampling variation is a source of uncertainty in
      our estimates, and although we can't eliminate it, we need to quantify
      it. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will calculate standard errors using "finite difference
      approximation". This involves altering each of the estimated parameter
      values one at a time by a very small amount, then
      seeing how much change in predicted value we get. We can then use the
      difference in the predicted values per unit change in the parameters to
      calculate an estimated "Hessian matrix". We will use the inverted
      Hessian, along with an estimate of the standard error of the Y data
      overall, to calculate the standard errors for each of the three
      parameters we estimated. This requires several
      steps.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Set up the worksheet to do the finite difference approximation.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Copy the entire parameter block (A15:B18) and paste it below, starting
      in cell a22.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      b. In cell C15 type "Parameter multiplier", and in cell C16, C17, and
      C18 enter a 1. We will change this value in order to change the
      parameters by a small amount.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      c. In cell B16 type =b23*c16. Copy and paste this to B17 and B18. This
      will now make the parameters depend on the 1's in c16-c18.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      d. Copy Pnet Predicted (c1:c9) and paste-special only the values to column
      D. Re-name it "Best fit" in cell D1.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      e. Label F1 "dY/dPhi", G1 "dY/dPmarea", and H1 "dY/dTheta". We will
      calculate the change in predicted Pnet when we change each parameter
      here.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      f. In cell f2 write the formula =(c2-d2)/(phi-b$23). This calculates
      the change in Y divided by the change in the Phi parameter. Since we
      haven't changed Phi yet both the numerator and denominator are 0, and
      we get a divide by zero error. This is okay for now. Copy and paste the
      formula to the rest of the cells in this column (f3:f9).</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      g. In cell g2 write the formula =(c2-d2)/(Pmarea - b$24). Copy and paste
      to g3:g9.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      h. In cell h2 write the formula =(c2-d2)/(theta - b$25). Copy and paste to
      h3:h9.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Calculate the differences. Now that you have everything set up, you're
      ready to change the
      parameters, one at a time, and record the change in predicted value per
      unit change in the parameter. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Change the "Parameter multiplier" for Phi to
      1.000001. You'll see
      that this changes the Phi parameter in cell B16, which changes the
      predicted Pnet's in column C, and causes the dY/dPhi's in F to
      calculate (they should no longer be "divide by zero" errors). Copy the
      cells in f2:f9, right-click and "Paste Special"
      only the values - you now have the first set of "deltas" (that is,
      changes in the curve with a small change in the Phi parameter). Once
      you've pasted the values, change the multiplier back to 1. Since this
      column is no longer made up of cell formulas, you should not have the
      values go back to divide by zero errors.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      b. Change the multiplier for Pmarea to 1.000001. Copy and paste-special
      the values in g2:g9, and change the multiplier back to 1.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      c. Change the multiplier for theta to 1.000001. Copy and paste-special the
      values in h2:h9, and change the multiplier back to 1.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Calculate the approximated Hessian matrix, and invert it. Now that
      you have the changes in predicted values per unit change in each
      parameter, you can use these to calculate an approximation to the
      Hessian matrix. The Hessian gives second order partial derivatives for
      parameters and their cross-products - these are instantaneous values,
      but we can approximate with our finite differences. All we need to do
      to get our approximated Hessian is to transpose the finite differences,
      then multiply the transposed matrix by the untransposed matrix. We can
      then invert the matrix, which will give us the numbers needed to
      calculate standard errors of our parameters.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Copy the dY's in f1:h9, and transpose them. Once you've copied the
      cells, click into cell j1, right-click, select paste-special, and check
      the "Transpose" box.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      b. Matrix multiply the matrix by its transpose to get sums of squares
      and cross-products. In cell F12 type "Hessian" (this is the "Hessian
      matrix" we are calculating). Since we're calculating three parameters,
      the result of this multiplication will be a 3x3 matrix, so select cells
      F13:H15, and then type =mmult(k1:r3, f2:h9). Remember to
      CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. The result will be sums of squares and cross-products
      for the deviations we calculated in F2 through H9.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      c. Invert the matrix. In cell F17 type "Inverted Hessian". Select cells
      F18:H20, and type =minverse(f13:h15), and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This will
      give you the inverse of the SSCP matrix.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Calculate the standard error of Pnet. This will be the standard
      error of the model overall, based on the sum of the squared residuals.
      If the data fit the model really well (such that we have a large r<sup>2</sup>,
      and a small sum of squared residuals), and/or we have a large sample
      size, the overall standard error will be small. Once we have this we
      will use it, along with some of the elements of the inverted Hessian,
      to calculate standard errors of the parameters.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. In cell B12 type "SE", and in
      cell C12 type = sqrt(c11/(8-3)). This is the formula for the standard
      error of light level, based on the sum of squared deviations in c11,
      and our model degrees of freedom. We have 8 light levels (n = 8), and
      are
      estimating three parameters, so the degrees of freedom are 8-3 = 5.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Calculate the standard errors. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. In cell C22 type "SE". In cell C23
      type = c12*sqrt(f18). This multiplies the standard error of Y we just
      calculated by the square root of the entry in the inverted
      Hessian matrix for the Phi parameter. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      b. In cell C24 type
      =c12*sqrt(g19). This is the standard error for Pmarea.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      c. In cell C25 type =c12*sqrt(h20). This is the standard error for Theta.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you switch to the "Top" sheet, you'll see that this entire analysis
      has been done for you so you can compare bottom leaves to top leaves.
      If you put everything in the right place in the Bottom sheet, the graph
      should now shows both lines plotted, and the "Top and Bottom compared"
      section gives the parameter estimates for both top and bottom of the
      tree, along with a t-test for differences between the parameters. If
      all went well, you should see that quantum yield is higher at the
      bottom of the tree, which means the leaves at the bottom of the tree
      are more efficient at using the light available. But, you'll also see
      that the maximum area-specific photosynthesis rate is higher for leaves
      at the top of the tree, which means that the leaves at the top can make
      better use of the abundant light they are exposed to at the top.
      Convexity isn't different between the two (the p-value is greater than
      0.05, so we retain the null hypothesis that they are no different from
      one another).</p>
