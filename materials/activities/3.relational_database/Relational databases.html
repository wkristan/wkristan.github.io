      <p class="part" id="intro"> We are only going to spend one week on
        relational databases, but we could easily spend the entire semester on
        them. We will focus on what is probably the feature that is most likely
        to be of use to you, and that Excel does not support at all: one to many
        relational joins. Unless you decide to learn more about MS Access on
        your own, outside of class, you will probably enter data in Excel,
        import it into Access, join your tables, then export the joined tables
        back into Excel. That is what we will do today.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb1" type="checkbox">1. Download this spreadsheet (<a href="mice.xlsx">mice.xlsx</a>),
        and save it to your H drive (make a new folder, ex2 - save the file to
        H:/biol365/ex2), and then open it in Excel.</p>
      <p> The data represent an experiment in which ten different mice were
        given different diets, and then their body weights were measured daily
        for a period of 10 days. There are several characteristics of each mouse
        that were recorded (age, sex, and the diet they were on), which are
        stored in the sheet "Mouse". Each mouse was weighed once a day for ten
        days, and these weights are in sheet "Weights". To do a comparison of
        weights by diet, we would need to join the Mouse table to the Weights
        table. We can't do that automatically in Excel (only through laborious,
        error-prone copying and pasting), but we can do it easily in Access.</p>
      <p>Be sure to close Excel before you proceed - Access won't open this file
        while Excel has it open. </p>
      <p> <input name="cb2" type="checkbox">2. Start MS Access 2013. You will
        see a fairly cluttered startup screen that looks <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="access_startup.jpeg">like this</a><span class="ipt">like this<span
            class="ip"><img src="access_startup.jpeg"></span></span>. We are
        going to ignore much of the clutter, but most of it is providing easy
        access to templates for a variety of common business databases (Access
        is marketed heavily towards business users).</p>
      <p> First, click on the "Blank desktop database" button, which will bring
        up a "Blank desktop database" creation window. Name the database
        "mice.accdb", and click on the "open folder" icon next to the file name
        field. You can now navigate to a suitable folder on your H: drive, and
        click "OK" to select the folder. Back in the "Blank desktop database"
        window click on "Create" to create the blank database in the folder you
        selected.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb3" type="checkbox">3. You will now see the Access
        interface with a new, blank table called Table1 (it will look <a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="access_interface.jpeg">like this</a><span
          class="ipt">like this<span class="ip"><img src="access_interface.jpeg"></span></span>).
        Rather than using this blank table, we are going to import data from
        your Excel spreadsheet. Click on the "<a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="access_interface1.jpeg">External data</a><span class="ipt">External
          Data<span class="ip"><img src="access_interface1.jpeg"></span></span>"
        tab, and then click on "<a class="link" style="display: none" href="access_interface2.jpeg">Excel</a><span
          class="ipt">Excel<span class="ip"><img src="access_interface2.jpeg"></span></span>".
        Browse to the "mice.xlsx" Excel spreadsheet you downloaded and select it.
        You will be importing the data into a new table, which is the default
        option, so click "OK".</p>
      <p> <input name="cb4" type="checkbox">4. The "Import Spreadsheet Wizard"
        that pops up will lead you through the process of importing the data.
        You will only be able to do one sheet at a time, so start with "Mouse" -
        click "Next".</p>
      <p> The next step asks whether the first row of the sheet contains the
        column headings. These will be used as the field names in Access - the
        sheet does include names for the columns, so click "Next".</p>
      <p> The next step allows you to set the data type for each of the columns.
        It will make a guess based on the contents of the file, but you may not
        like the choices made and you need to check. Use the variable types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mouse ID is numeric, but it only contains numbers up to 10 with no
          decimals, so change the Data Type from "Double" to "Integer" ("single"
          and "double" are both floating-point data types used for decimal
          numbers; double can record more significant digits than single).</li>
        <li>Ages are all integer numbers, so change the type to "Integer" (ages
          are in months, and none are greater than 255). </li>
        <li>The last two columns are text, which you can confirm Access guessed
          correctly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have the variable type definitions done, press "Next". </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="pkey">Primary keys</h3>
      <p>The next screen allows you to create a "<strong>primary key</strong>"
        for the table. A primary key is a unique identifier for every record in
        the data table, and relational databases have to have a unique
        identifier for every record. Access will allow you to create a new
        variable to use as a primary key, and populate it with sequential
        numbers for you, but if you have a unique identifier in your data set
        already you can use that instead. Since mouse ID will always be
        different for different mice you can use it as the primary key - click
        on "Choose my own primary key" and select "Mouse ID". Click "Next".</p>
      <p>Finally, you are given the chance to change the name of the table if
        you choose - "Mouse" is fine, so don't change anything. Click "Finish".
        If you are prompted to save the import steps you don't need to - this is
        only useful if you repeatedly import data with the same organization,
        such as updating a database with new data each day. </p>
      <p>You will see a new table called "Mouse" in the list on the left of the
        screen, and if you double-click it the table will open and show you the
        data (it should look <a class="link" style="display: none" href="mouse_table.jpeg">like
          this</a><span class="ipt">like this<span class="ip"><img src="mouse_table.jpeg"></span></span>).
        </p>
      <p> <input name="cb5" type="checkbox">5. Repeat the import routine for
        sheet Weights. You will need to repeat steps 3 and 4, using Weights as
        the sheet to be imported.</p>
      <p>Set the variables to the following data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mouse ID = integer</li>
        <li>Measurement Day = integer</li>
        <li>Weight = double (double refers to double-precision floating point
          numbers, which is a good choice for decimal data).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Allow Access to create a primary key for this table - since there are
        multiple records of the same mice we can't use Mouse ID as a primary key
        here.</p>
      <p>When you're done you'll see a new table, Weights, in your list.
        Double-click it and you'll <a class="link" style="display: none" href="weights_table.jpeg">see
          this</a><span class="ipt">see this<span class="ip"><img src="weights_table.jpeg"></span></span>.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="joining">Relational joins</h3>
      <p> <input name="cb6" type="checkbox">6. Join the Mouse and Weights data
        based on matching Mouse ID's. Joining is done in a query, which is a
        term that refers to all manner of operations that retrieve data from a
        database.</p>
      <p>To open the query design view switch to the "<a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="create.jpeg">Create</a><span class="ipt">Create<span class="ip"><img
              src="create.jpeg"></span></span>" tab, and select the "<a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="query_design.jpeg">Query Design</a><span class="ipt">Query
          Design<span class="ip"><img src="query_design.jpeg"></span></span>"
        option.</p>
      <p> In the "Show Table" form that pops up, select and add both the Mouse
        and Weights tables. Close the "Show Table" form.</p>
      <p> Now that you have the tables added, you are in the "Query Design"
        view. The tables you added are at the top, each showing a list of the
        fields they contain - we will be establishing the relationship between
        the tables (i.e. linking the tables by their matching columns) here.
        Below the tables is what looks like a blank spreadsheet - this is where
        we will actually build the query by selecting the fields from the joined
        tables that we want to display. </p>
      <p> You'll see that since we have a field called "Mouse ID" in each table,
        Access guessed (correctly) that this is the column that's common between
        the tables, and that should be the basis for joining them together. You
        can see this as a black line that connects the two tables, like <a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="relationship.jpeg">this</a><span class="ipt">this<span
            class="ip"><img src="relationship.jpeg"></span></span>. It's nice
        when Access guesses the relationship correctly, but you need to learn to
        do this yourself - so, click on the black line to select it, then hit
        the "delete" key. To make the connection yourself, click on the "Mouse
        ID" label in the "Mouse" table, drag it to the "Weights" table, and then
        drop it on top of the "Mouse ID" label there.</p>
      <p>We have a single column that defines the matching rows in our data, but
        you can actually have more than one column that indicates the
        relationship. For example, if we had mice with two different strains,
        with each mouse numbered sequentially within a strain, we would need the
        combination of strain and mouse number to uniquely identify the mice.
        All we would need is a column in each table that indicates the strain,
        and another that indicates the mouse number. We could then make two
        links between the tables, one that linked the strain columns and another
        that linked the mouse numbers, and Access would be able to join the
        records correctly.</p>
      <p>If you double-click on the black line, you'll see that there are
        different ways to make the link between the table. The difference
        between them is in which records will be displayed in the event that
        there are Mouse ID's in one that aren't found in the other. The choices
        are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only include rows where the joined fields from both tables are equal</li>
        <li>Include ALL records from "Mouse" and only those records from
          "Weights" where the joined fields are equal</li>
        <li>Include ALL records from "Weights" and only those records from
          "Mouse" where the joined fields are equal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will want to use the first option when either you know that all the
        records match between the tables, or when you want to drop data from the
        query if the records are incomplete. The second and third cases are
        useful to help you identify where there are missing values in one table
        or the other. You can click on the "Cancel" button to close the Join
        Properties.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="query">Queries</h3>
      <p> <input name="cb9" type="checkbox">9. Now that the tables and their
        relationships are all set up, we can build the query to combine the
        fields in Mouse with the fields in Weights. Double click on the
        following fields to add them to the query:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mouse table - Mouse ID, Age, Sex, and Diet</li>
        <li>Weight table - Measurement Day, and Weight</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that we only included Mouse ID once (it doesn't matter which table
        it comes from), and we didn't include the ID primary key field from the
        Weight table at all. In this sense we are not only using the query to
        combine information from both tables, we are also using it to filter
        which fields are to be included.</p>
      <p> <input name="cb10" type="checkbox">10. Execute the query. To run the
        query, click on "<a class="link" style="display: none" href="view.jpeg">View</a><span
          class="ipt">View<span class="ip"><img src="view.jpeg"></span></span>"
        to switch from design view (in which you build the query) to datasheet
        view (in which you see the result). You should see a table with the
        weights for each day, but now with all the Mouse table fields repeated
        for each day of weighing (<a class="link" style="display: none" href="query_result.jpeg">like
          this</a><span class="ipt">like this<span class="ip"><img src="query_result.jpeg"></span></span>).</p>
      <p>Note that this joined file has all the ages, sexes, and diets repeated
        for each day of measurement, without having to actually enter this
        information multiple times.</p>
      <p>Also, be aware that the query is a temporary, on-the-fly arrangement.
        Queries can be saved and re-executed to re-create a view of the joined
        files, and queries can even be used as though they are tables - you can
        make a query that uses another query as a table, for example. Given
        this, it is generally not needed to make a permanent table from a query
        for use within Access.</p>
      <p>However, to use the joined data to do some analysis in another program,
        such as Excel, you will need to export the query. That's what you'll do
        next.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="exporting">Exporting a query to Excel</h3>
      <p> <input name="cb11" type="checkbox">11. Export the joined file to an
        Excel spreadsheet. The simplest, quickest way to get the data back into
        Excel is to copy and paste it. Open the mouse.xlsx file in Excel, then click
        on the box in the upper left corner of the Access query (<a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="select_records.jpeg">here</a><span class="ipt">here<span
            class="ip"><img src="select_records.jpeg"></span></span>) to select
        all the records. Right-click and copy them, and then switch to Excel and
        paste them in sheet 3.</p>
      <p> Another way is to export the data to an Excel spreadsheet file. First,
        save the query (click on the save icon, and call it "Joined files"). It
        now appears below the Weights table in the list to the left of the
        screen. Select "Joined files" from the list, right-click and select
        "Export" â†’ "Excel". In the wizard that pops up, put the new "Joined
        files.xlsx" file onto your H: drive. If you then open the file in Excel,
        you will have a joined version of the tables, ready to summarize in a
        pivot table.</p>
      <p><input name="cb12" type="checkbox">12. Export just the Females. We
        already used the query to decide which variables to include and not
        include in the data set, but we can also filter the data within a
        variable like we did in Excel. To do this, you will go back to the
        Design view for your Joined files query, and add a statement that will
        only return records for female mace.</p>
      <p>If it isn't open, double-click on the Joined files query. In the upper
        left end of the Home tab, click on View (if a drop-down menu pops up,
        select Design. Otherwise clicking on View should open up the Design view
        by default). You should see your joined tables, with your fields below.</p>
      <p>If you look at the field list in the lower panel, you'll see that on
        the left side are the labels "Field", "Table", "Sort", "Show",
        "Criteria", and "or". To only show the females, you need to add a
        Criteria to the Sex column. In the Criteria cell (just below the Show
        checkbox), type "Female" (with or without quotes - if you don't use
        quotes Access will add them). Note that this will only work if you type
        Female correctly - don't add spaces after it, or before it, or change to
        lowercase.</p>
      <p>If you run this, you will see only female data in the result.
        Right-click on the tab for the query and save it again so that the new
        Females criteria is saved.</p>
      <p>You can now export this version of the query by right-clicking on the
        query, and save it as "Joined files females.xlsx".</p>
      <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>
      <p>Another excellent reason to use a relational database is that it's
        possible to create data entry forms that make data entry and retrieval
        easier. It's possible to make an Access form match the appearance of a
        paper form that you use to collect data so that data entry is less
        confusing.</p>
      <p>When you have a one to many relationship between data tables, like we
        do, it's also possible to use a form to make it easier to enter data
        into both tables at once. In our case, we can enter new "mouse" level
        information in one part of the form, and enter the daily measurements of
        weights into another part of the form, and the information will be
        automatically placed in the correct table.</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">1. Make sure you have the "Mouse" table selected
        in the table list on the left side of your database window. Switch to
        the "Create" tab, and then "Form" button (<a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="form_button.png">here</a><span class="ipt">here<span class="ip"><img
              src="form_button.png"></span></span>). This will make a basic form
        that includes all of the fields that are in the "Mouse" table.</p>
      <p>You will be automatically put into "Layout" mode, which is used to
        design the appearance and behavior of the form. At this point you can
        also scroll through the records in the "Mouse" table by clicking on the
        navigation buttons at the bottom of the form window (<a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="form_scroll_through_records.png">here</a><span class="ipt">here<span
            class="ip"><img src="form_scroll_through_records.png"></span></span>).</p>
      <p>Initially, only fields from the "Mouse" table were included, but we
        would also like to include the daily weight measurements we collect.
        There is a one to many relationship between each record in the "Mouse"
        table and records in the "Weights" table, so we want to make the form
        show us all of the weights for whatever mouse is currently displayed. To
        do this we need to add a subform.</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">2. Find the subform button in the list of
        available controls above the form (<a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="form_subform_button.png">here</a><span class="ipt">here<span class="ip"><img
              src="form_subform_button.png">here</span></span>). As you move
        down over the form, you will see a red dimension line that indicates
        where the subform will be positioned if you click the mouse - move your
        mouse so that the dimension line is below the fields that are already in
        the form (below Diet), and left-click the mouse.</p>
      <p>The subform is initially blank, and has a label on the left that is
        called "Child14:" - we'll fix both of those issues next.</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">3. Double-click on the "Child14:" label, and it
        will become editable - change it to "Weights".</p>
      <p>Now, select just the blank box to the right of the label - this is
        where the data will appear, once we tell Access where to get it.</p>
      <p>When you select the field, the "Property Sheet" on the right side of
        the database window will show a long list of properties, in several
        tabs. The first tab gives a long list of appearance settings - we will
        leave those alone. You should see though that "Child14" is listed in the
        dropdown menu box above the tabs - this means that all of the properties
        pertain to our subform.</p>
      <p>You can change the name of the subform to something easier to remember
        - switch to the "Other" tab and change the "Name" from "Child14" to
        "WeightSubForm" (no spaces, use capitals to separate words). You'll see
        that the name changes in the dropdown menu, so we still are seeing
        properties of our subform.</p>
      <p>Now, switch to the "Data" tab in the "Property Sheet". We need to
        identify the "Weights" table as the source of data to display in this
        subform, so drop down the "Source Object" menu and select the "Weights"
        table. You'll see the table appears in the subform.</p>
      <p>We also need to tell Access how the data in the subform relates to the
        data in the main form. We do this by clicking on "Link Master Fields"
        and then clicking the ellipses button (...) - Access will notice we have
        two fields with the same name in each table, and will suggest them as
        the fields to use to link the tables. The "Master" Mouse ID refers to
        the main form that has "Mouse" fields in it, and the "Child" Mouse ID
        refers to the subform that has the "Weights" fields. Access guessed
        right, so click "OK" to accept the choices.</p>
      <p>The subform has its own set of navigation controls - you can scroll
        through the individual weight records using the subform navigation
        tools, and can scroll from one mouse to another using the main form
        navigation controls. As you switch from one mouse to another you will
        see that only the records for the mouse selected in the main form are
        displayed in the subform.</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">4. To finish making the form, re-size the
        subform by dragging the lower right corner down until all ten days of
        measurement are showing.</p>
      <p>Now that the form is done, drop down the "View" button and change it to
        "Form view" - this will disable editing, and prevent you from
        accidentally changing the form itself.</p>
      <p><input type="checkbox">5. Let's see what this does for us when it comes
        to data entry. Scroll the main form to the first mouse, Mouse 1.</p>
      <p>In the subform window, enter the following:</p>
      <p>ID: No change, this field gets filled in automatically (it's the
        primary key for the table).</p>
      <p>Mouse ID: No change, the ID is filled in automatically because it is
        the field that joins the two tables (having Mouse ID 1 in the main form
        makes these all Mouse ID 1 as well).</p>
      <p>Measurement: 11</p>
      <p>Weight: 30</p>
      <p>Hit "Enter" after you enter the weight so that it is accepted as an
        entry.</p>
      <p>Once all the fields are filled in, open the "Weights" table&nbsp; from
        the Tables list and you'll see your new entry at the very bottom of the
        table.</p>
      <p>To start a record for a new mouse, switch back to your form, and click
        on the "New (blank) record" button in the navigation tools at the bottom
        of the form (<a class="link" style="display: none" href="form_new_main_form_record.png">here</a><span
          class="ipt">here<span class="ip"><img src="form_new_main_form_record.png"></span></span>).
        A new main form record is added, and since there are no matching weights
        for this new animal the subform goes blank. Enter the following into the
        main form:</p>
      <p>Mouse ID: 11</p>
      <p>Age: 2</p>
      <p>Sex: Female</p>
      <p>Diet: Cheese (yeah, I know...but it will make the record easy to find
        once you're done)</p>
      <p>Hit Enter and open the "Mouse" table - you should see this new record
        listed (if the table is already open you may need to close its tab and
        open it again to see the new record). </p>
      <p>You can switch back to your form and add some rows - feel free to put
        in whatever you want just so you have something to see - and you'll see
        it show up in the Weights table, with the needed Mouse ID to keep the
        weights linked to the mouse information.</p>
      <p>Right-click on the tab for your form and select "Save".</p>
