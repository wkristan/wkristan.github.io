      <p class="part" id="intro">Today we will analyze grouped data in a variety
        of ways: a) as a traditional one-way ANOVA, b) as a dummy-coded
        regression, and c) as a general linear model (GLM). Since GLM expresses
        all analyses as regressions, we expect that all three of these
        approaches will give identical results, but with different standard
        output. By comparing the output we get from each approach we can begin
        to learn how to interpret GLM output when we are using it to conduct an
        analysis of variance on grouped data. We will also learn how to take
        advantage of the tests of coefficients that are part of the standard GLM
        output, but not part of the standard ANOVA output in R. </p>

                eggs laid in nests of various host species (if you have taken
                Biol 215 here you probably recognize it). European cuckoos are
                nest parasites, which means they do not build nests of their
                own, but instead place their eggs in the nests of other "host"
                bird species. They have been observed laying their eggs on the
                ground, picking them up in their beaks, and then depositing them
                in a host nest nearby.</p>

                species' chicks. Cuckoo chicks hatch quickly and grow rapidly
                after hatching, and are able to actively eject the host species'
                eggs from the nest. Hosts often end up raising only the cuckoo
                chick.</p>

              <p>One of the host species cuckoos use is the European wren. Wrens
                are quite a bit smaller than meadow pipits, and you can see that
                feeding such a large cuckoo chick must be very taxing for such a
                small host. At some point the food needs of the cuckoo chick
                could exceed the host pair's foraging ability, and the cuckoo
                chick may starve. The size of the egg is related to the size of
                the chick, such that smaller cuckoo eggs tend to give rise to
                smaller adults.</p>
              <p>Given this, it seems likely that a female cuckoo's reproductive
                success would increase if she matched her egg sizes to the size
                of the host species. These data were measured by Oswald Latter
                in 1902 using museum egg collections to address this question.</p>

      <p>The question we are asking is, are cuckoo egg lengths different in
        different host species nests?</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
      <p>To begin, download <a href="cuckoo_all_species.xls">this</a> file, and
        save it to your h-drive.</p>
      <p>Recall from lecture that when there are only two groups, we can
        dummy-code the groups with a single numeric variable and analyze data as
        a simple linear regression. We will demonstrate this with just two host
        species first, and then later we will generalize the approach to the
        full set of six host species. Normally it would not be necessary to
        dummy code factors (i.e. categorical variables) by hand, because R will
        take care of it for us. We will do it today to help you understand how
        the process works, but will let R take care of this tedious work for us
        hereafter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="twosp">Two host species</h3>
      <h4>A. Dummy coding the two species data</h4>
      <p>1. Import the "two_sp" sheet into R Studio, and call the R data set
        "twosp". You will see there are 15 measurements of cuckoo egg length for
        each of two host species, the wren and the tree pipit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. Start a new R Script for your commands - remember, this will allow
        you to record all your steps, and to fix mistakes, so that you have a
        nice clean, repeatable set of steps to refer to, and to document your
        work.</p>
      <p>3. The first thing we need to do is to make a dummy-coded version of
        the Species column. We can take advantage of the model.matrix() command
        in R to do this for us, but model.matrix() produces a column for the
        intercept of the model as well - we will use it, but then will drop the
        intercept column so that all that is left is the dummy-coded species.</p>
      <p>So, in your R script, enter the line:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">model.matrix(~twosp$species)</p>
      <p>and run it. You'll see that on the console you will get a column for
        the intercept, and one for the dummy-coded Wren. There is some
        additional stuff at the bottom that gives attributes of the matrix that
        we won't use - we aren't actually interested in the entire model matrix,
        just the dummy-coded Wren column, so we can ignore the rest for now.</p>
      <p>To get just the dummy-coded column, edit the command to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">model.matrix(~twosp$species)[ , -1]</p>
      <p>and run it. The model.matrix() command returns a matrix, and we can
        extract the part of the matrix we want as part of the command. Adding a
        row, column index at the end causes only the rows and columns specified
        to be returned. The row index in the first position is blank, so all
        rows are returned. Using a negative in front of the 1 in the column
        index position causes the first column to be dropped, such that only the
        dummy-coded Wren column is returned.</p>
      <p>Finally, to get this column added to the twosp data set, edit the
        command once again to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">model.matrix(~twosp$species)[,-1] -&gt; twosp$Wren</p>
      <p>If you look at twosp you'll see that there is now a new Wren column,
        which has a 1 in every row that is a Wren, and a 0 for every row that is
        a Tree Pipit.</p>
      <h4>B. Look at your data</h4>
      <p>Load the gplots package, and use plotmeans() to graph the lengths
        grouped by species.</p>
      <p>The plot will give you a mean for Tree Pipit and a mean for Wren, and
        the 95% CI's should be clearly non-overlapping, with a low mean for
        Wren. You would expect that the ANOVA should be significant given this.</p>
      <p>We will conduct an ANOVA with these data using species as the grouping
        variable, and then use regression with Wren as the predictor. Both of
        these analyses will ask the same question about the data (i.e. can
        length be explained by species), but the regression approach will use
        the mean for one species as the intercept (which we'll call the
        "baseline" group), and the slope of the regression line will be the
        difference between the baseline species and the other species. </p>
      <p>Take a look at the plot - you have set Wren to 1, and Tree Pipit to 0
        in your dummy-coded column. When you use regression or GLM to analyze
        the differences between the groups, which species mean will be equal to
        the intercept term? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('who_is_zero')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div style="display: none;" id="who_is_zero">
        <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> The Tree Pipit is the 0
          group, so the intercept will be the tree pipit mean. </p>
      </div>
      <p> Should the coefficient on the Wren dummy variable be positive or
        negative? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('wren_pos_neg')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div style="display: none;" id="wren_pos_neg">
        <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> The coefficient on the
          dummy variable is going to be the difference between the zero group
          mean and the 1 group mean. Since Wrens have a lower mean than Tree
          Pipits the coefficient will be negative. </p>
      </div>
      <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,sans-serif;">Start
          a new file in MS Word, and copy and paste your graph into your Word
          file.</span></p>
      <h4>C. ANOVA</h4>
      <p>1. We'll start with the analysis you already know how to use for
        comparing means of grouped data, ANOVA. </p>
      <p>We used the aov() function to do ANOVA last time, but the lm() function
        can do ANOVA as well. If we use a categorical variable as the predictor
        in the model formula then we will get ANOVA output from lm(), and if we
        use a numeric predictor we get regression output. So, to get our ANOVA
        use the commands:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(length ~ species, data = twosp) -&gt; twosp.anova</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(twosp.anova) </p>
      <p>The first command conducts the analysis, and the second produces the
        ANOVA table.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. Copy and paste the ANOVA table into your MS Word document. If it
        looks scrambled in Word, select the output and change its font to
        Courier.</p>
      <p>Load the biol531 package, and use the summarySE function to make a
        table of summary statistics for the two species. Copy and paste it to
        your Word file as well.</p>
      <p>Now that we know what the ANOVA table should look like, you can move on
        to using regression on our dummy coded variable.</p>
      <h4>D. Regression with dummy coded species</h4>
      <p>1. To do your regression analysis, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(length ~ Wren, data = twosp) -&gt; twosp.lm</p>
      <p>If you type the name twosp.lm in the console you'll see the
        coefficients reported. Copy the output and paste it into your Word file.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. Now that the model is fit, generate an ANOVA table using the
        command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(twosp.lm)</p>
      <p>You'll see that the ANOVA table is exactly the same, except that Wren
        is shown as the predictor instead of species.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. Copy and paste the ANOVA table to Word, below the first block of
        output.</p>
      <p>Now that you have an idea of how this works using a simple example with
        only two species to compare, we'll repeat the procedure with six
        species.<br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="sixsp">Six host species</h3>
      <h4>A. Dummy coding the six species data.</h4>
      <p>1. Import the "all_sp" worksheet into an R data set called allsp.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. We will use the model.matrix() command again, but since we will now
        have 5 columns to represent 6 species we need to do a little more work
        to get the dummy codes into the allsp data set, labeled properly.</p>
      <p>To get the dummy-coded columns into the allsp data set, use the
        command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(allsp, model.matrix(~allsp$species)[,-1]) -&gt;
        allsp</p>
      <p>The data.frame() command is used to work with R data sets (called "data
        frames" in R terminology). This command is taking an existing data
        frame, allsp, and adding on columns using our model.matrix() statement.
        Remember, using the -1 in the row, column index in square brackets drops
        the intercept term, and leaves behind only the dummy-coded species.
        Assigning back into allsp replaces allsp with this new data frame. You
        should now have 7 columns in allsp, the 2 original ones plus 5
        dummy-coded columns.</p>
      <p>But, we're not done yet - the default naming on the dummy-coded columns
        is needlessly messy and difficult to read, so we need to re-label them.
        If you type the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(allsp)</p>
      <p>you'll see that column 3 through 7 are labeled by the name of the data
        frame and the species column, and only then give the name of the
        species. We can replace just these 5 column names with the names we want
        by assigning new values with the colnames() command - modify it to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(allsp)[3:7] &lt;-
        c("Meadow.Pipit","Pied.Wagtail","Robin","Tree.Pipit","Wren") </p>
      <p>This command identifies the 3rd through the 7th column name, and sets
        them to the vector of labels on the right.</p>
      <p> </p>
      You're all set to move on to some graphing and analysis.<br>
      <h4>B. Look at your data.</h4>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Produce another plot comparing means for the six host species in this
        data set, like you did for two species (you can use the species column
        for grouping). Copy and paste the graph into Word.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the plot - now Hedge Sparrow is the species with 0 on
        all the dummy coded variables. What will the intercept represent? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('who_is_zero_six')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div style="display: none;" id="who_is_zero_six">
        <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> The intercept will now
          be the hedge sparrow mean. </p>
      </div>
      <p> Should the coefficient on the Wren dummy variable be positive or
        negative? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('wren_pos_neg_six')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div style="display: none;" id="wren_pos_neg_six">
        <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> Cuckoo eggs in wren
          nests are the smallest, so the difference between Hedge Sparrow and
          Wren is negative. For the other species, any that are above Hedge
          Sparrow will be positive, and any that are below Hedge Sparrow will be
          negative. </p>
      </div>
      <h4>C. ANOVA</h4>
      <p>Conduct an ANOVA on these six species, as you did for the two species
        data set. Use the same naming convention as we started using with two
        species - use "allsp.anova" for the name of the model. Record the same
        output as you did for the two group analysis (including the table of
        species means).</p>
      <h4>D. (Multiple) Regression</h4>
      <p>To conduct a regression using the dummy-coded variables is to conduct
        your first <strong>multiple regression</strong>. We will learn more
        about multiple regression in the coming weeks, but for now you just need
        to know that we are still predicting a single response (length), but we
        will be using each dummy-coded column as a predictor. The command for
        this analysis is thus:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(length ~ Meadow.Pipit + Pied.Wagtail + Robin +
        Tree.Pipit + Wren, data = allsp) -&gt; allsp.lm </p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(allsp.lm)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Run the analysis and record the ANOVA table in your Word document. It
        will look like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Analysis of Variance Table <br>

      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The ANOVA table you get from this approach has a line for each dummy
        variable. In a multiple regression each predictor is tested for its
        effect on egg length separately. Since regression predictors get 1
        degrees of freedom, across all of the predictors we are using 5 degrees
        of freedom, which is the same as when we used species in an ANOVA. If
        this is the same analysis as our ANOVA, the sums of squares explained by
        these 5 predictors should be the same as the species sums of squares we
        got when species was used as a grouping variable in our ANOVA. We can
        check this by extracting the sums of squares from the table and summing
        them.</p>
      <p>The ANOVA table we get with anova(allsp.lm) is structured with several
        named components. To see what they are use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">names(anova(allsp.lm))</p>
      <p>You'll see the output:</p>
      <p class="rout">[1] "Df"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sum Sq"&nbsp;
        "Mean Sq" "F value" "Pr(&gt;F)"&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The sums of squares are the second named component, called "Sum Sq". We
        can pull just the sums of squares with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(allsp.lm)["Sum Sq"]</p>
      <p>We're using the square brackets this time to specify the name of a
        named component, rather than giving an index number. We could get the
        same thing with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(allsp.lm)[2]</p>
      <p>because the sums of squares are the second named component. You'll see
        that the final row of the sums of squares column is the residual SS -
        this is the unexplained, random variation. It equals the residual SS
        from your ANOVA, but we don't want to include it in our sum of the SS
        explained by our five dummy-coded species. So, we can sum all but the
        final row of this column using the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">sum(anova(allsp.lm)[-6, "Sum Sq"])</p>
      <p>This will give you a total of the five dummy-coded predictors, and it
        should equal the SS for species that you got in your ANOVA.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rout">
      <p>Use summary() to get the coefficients - put the summary output into
        Word as well. Note that each of the slope coefficients has a t-test
        associated with it, as does the intercept. Each of these tests is
        comparing the coefficient estimate to 0 - this is a silly thing to do
        for the intercept in this case, because the intercept is the mean for
        Hedge Sparrow, which we already know can't be 0 (why?). Since the slopes
        on the dummy-coded predictors are all actually the differences between
        the species means and the Hedge Sparrow mean, testing these against 0
        makes some sense - if they are significant it means that the mean for
        the species is different from the mean for Hedge Sparrow. We'll learn
        more about these test when we learn about contrasts later in the
        semester. </p>
      <p>Since the SS are the same, and the DF for species is the same as the
        sum of the DF for the dummy-coded predictors, the rest of the ANOVA has
        to be the same - MS are SS/DF, and F is a ratio of the mean squares.<br>
      </p>
      <div style="display: none;" id="resid">
        <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> Remember that all we are
          doing by dummy coding is representing our six species with five
          numeric variables. The analysis is still about comparing the amount of
          variation we can explain (in terms of differences in average between
          species) to the amount of variation we can't explain (in terms of
          individual variation around the averages). So, if all we're doing is
          expressing group means using regression coefficients, then we should
          explain exactly the same amount of variation when we use regression,
          and we should thus leave exactly the same amount unexplained. The
          residual term should be the same for both. </p>

      <h4>E. Setting wrens as the comparison group</h4>
      <p>R needs to convert categorical variables into factors to use them in
        analysis. Making a factor involves finding all the unique words in the
        column, sorting them alphabetically, and assigning them a number
        starting with 1 and going up to the number of levels in the factor. It
        then uses the alphabetical list of the actual text species names as the
        "levels" of the factor, and substitutes these level names for the
        internally assigned numbers when it displays the factor on the screen.</p>
      <p>When you use a factor in a GLM, R by default will use the level that
        comes first alphabetically as the baseline level. You may not want it to
        do that. Remember from lecture that it's possible to get some mileage
        out of the coefficient tests if you set the level you want to compare
        all the other levels to as the baseline. If, for example, one of your
        levels was a "control", and the rest were various types of treatments,
        you might want to compare all of the treatments to the control - if so,
        setting the control level as the baseline makes the coefficient tests do
        this work for you. </p>
      <p>This study of cuckoo egg sizes is not a very good example because there
        isn't a single species we are using as a "control". But, even though
        this cuckoo egg study was not designed to compare all the other species
        to Wrens, we are going to learn how to specify which group is the
        baseline so you can do it in other contexts when it is more appropriate.</p>
      <p>To change the order so that Wren comes first use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">allsp$species &lt;- factor(allsp$species, levels =
        c("Wren","Hedge Sparrow","Meadow Pipit", "Pied Wagtail","Robin","Tree
        Pipit"))&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The factor() command on the right side of the assignment operator is
        specifying the order of the levels, using Wren as the first one. The new
        re-ordered factor is assigned back into the species column of allsp,
        which replaces the original alphabetically ordered factor with the new
        one.</p>
      <p>Now, if you run your ANOVA command again and do a summary() on the
        results you'll see this:</p>

      <p>If you look closely at the block of output at the bottom, nothing is
        different from the same block for your original six-species ANOVA - you
        still have the same residual standard error, multiple r-squared,
        F-statistic, and p-value as when you used the original, default ordering
        on the species variable. But, now Wren is the species that is missing
        from the list of predictors, and it is thus the baseline group. Since
        all of the species are being compared to Wren, rather than to Hedge
        Sparrow, all the t-tests of the coefficients are different. If we were
        only concerned with differences between the Wren and the rest of the
        species, this would be a good way to test for those differences.</p>
