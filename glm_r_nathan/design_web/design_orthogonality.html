      <p class="part" id="intro">Experiments test for cause and effect
        relationships between variables, by manipulating a predictor variable
        and observing change in a response variable. A good experiment should do
        two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It should enable us to detect real treatment effects, if they exist,
          with a minimum of time and money expended</li>
        <li>It should eliminating the possibility that we will conclude there is
          a cause and effect relationship between variables when there isn't
          one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether an experiment is successful in reaching these goals is not
        completely under the control of the scientist. However, success is
        strongly influenced by choices the scientist makes in designing the
        experiment, and it is certainly possible for bad design choices to make
        correct conclusions impossible to reach.</p>
      <p>In your introductory statistics class you probably learned some form of
        the Experimental Ideal - that is, that you should hold constant every
        possible "nuisance" variable that could affect your data, and manipulate
        only the predictor variable whose effects you are testing. You may have
        also learned that variables that can't be held constant should be
        randomized to avoid having them produce a spurious result - that is, one
        that appears to be due to the treatment, but is instead due to some
        other difference between the groups.</p>
      <p>But, now that you are learning to use more complex statistical models
        to analyze data, you have available to you a third option for dealing
        with nuisance variables - namely, measuring them and statistically
        eliminating them from your test of the treatment. You learned how to use
        multiple regression to statistically eliminate a nuisance variable last
        week, and the same basic principle applies to categorical variables as
        well. The method used to statistically eliminate a nuisance categorical
        variable is called <strong>blocking</strong>.</p>
      <p>Let's look at a quick plant growth experiment example to illustrate how
        blocking works. Say you are testing the effects of fertilizer on plant
        growth, and you have six pots in each of two treatment groups:
        fertilized and control. You have two greenhouses to use, and only have
        enough in each for six of your twelve pots. Greenhouses can have
        different growing conditions (temperature, humidity) that affect plant
        growth, so greenhouse is a nuisance variable. How should you allocate
        the pots? </p>
      <table width="100%" border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>A conspicuously bad choice would be to do this - all of the
                control plants (yellow pots) are in one greenhouse (gray), and
                all the fertilized plants (blue pots) are in another (orange).
                If we see a difference between control and fertilized pots, we
                can't be sure it's due to the fertilizer, because it could just
                as easily be an effect of greenhouse. Greenhouse and treatment
                are <strong>confounded</strong>, meaning that they can't be
                told apart.</p>
              <p>You can think of the confounded effects issue this way - to
                test the effect of a treatment, you need to <strong>isolate</strong>
                its effects from any other possible cause of a response. This
                means that your experiment should make it <em>impossible</em>
                for any factor other than the treatment of interest to be
                responsible for the observed responses - a good experiment
                leaves <em>only one viable explanation</em> for the results.
                With this confounding of greenhouse and fertilizer treatment,
                there are two viable explanations for the result - bad design.</p>

            <td>
              <p>Dealing with the nuisance greenhouse effect by randomizing
                would look like this - every pot is selected at random to be
                assigned to a greenhouse, regardless of its treatment type. We
                wouldn't record the greenhouse and account for it here - we
                would just trust that randomizing prevents greenhouse from being
                confounded with treatment, and would analyze the data with a
                simple one-way ANOVA.</p>
              <p>It's true that treatment and greenhouse are not completely
                confounded anymore, but they aren't completely independent of
                one another either. By chance you will often end up with more of
                one treatment in one greenhouse and this unevenness at least
                some of the apparent effect of fertilizer could be due to an
                effect of greenhouse instead. </p>
              <p>But, even more problematically, any effect that greenhouse has
                on the data is still present in the data, and we aren't
                accounting for it. The variation due to greenhouse becomes part
                of the error term in our ANOVA table.</p>

              <p>The best approach, that both prevents confounding and minimizes
                the size of the error term, is to block on greenhouse. Blocking
                means to use all possible combinations of treatment level and
                block - so, control and fertilized pots appear in each
                greenhouse, which makes this a <strong>complete</strong> block
                design. Assuming we have already randomly assigned pots to
                treatment and control groups, we would also want to randomly
                select which of the controls go to greenhouse 1, and which go to
                greenhouse 2 - this makes the design a <strong>randomized
                  complete block</strong> design. Using the same number of each
                treatment level in each greenhouse makes it a <strong>balanced
                  randomized complete block</strong> design.</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>To get the full benefit of blocking, you need to do two distinct
        things, each with a different benefit:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You need to use a balanced, randomized complete block design when
            you execute the experiment. The benefit of doing this is that that
            there is no confounding at all of treatment and greenhouse. Even if
            we didn't account for the greenhouse block effect in our statistical
            analysis, blocking on greenhouse in the experiment equally
            distributes the greenhouse effect between the two treatment levels,
            and we could not possibly mistake an effect of greenhouse for an
            effect of fertilizer treatment - we have made greenhouse and
            treatment orthogonal by design.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You need to account for the block effect in your statistical
            analysis. If we didn't include greenhouse as a predictor, all of the
            variation due to greenhouse would end up in the error term. Using
            the greenhouse block variable as a predictor in our ANOVA places all
            of the effect of greenhouse into the greenhouse term in the ANOVA
            table, and keeps it out of the error term. Doing this increases the
            effect size for the fertilizer treatment.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> This last statement may strike you as foolishness - accounting for the
        effect of greenhouse is good stuff, sure, but it doesn't change the
        effect of the fertilizer, right? To understand what I mean by increasing
        the effect size, you need to understand what statisticians mean by
        effect size.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="effect_size">Effect size</h2>
      <p>Effect size refers to the amount of differential response that is
        produced by the treatments. A simple measure of effect size for a
        two-group experiment is&nbsp;the number of standard deviations between
        group means, which is known as "Cohen's d". To calculate it, you divide
        the amount of difference between two means by the pooled standard
        deviation: d = (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>treatment</sub>
        - <span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>control</sub>)
        / s.</p>
      <p>You can think of Cohen's d as a signal to noise ratio, where the signal
        is the amount of difference between the group means that you've
        measured, and the noise is unexplained random variation in the data.</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>There is no universally accepted criteria for interpreting
                effect sizes, and there are several different measures that
                could be used, but for Cohen's d effect sizes over 1 are
                generally considered large, effect sizes around 0.5 are
                moderate, and effect sizes of 0.1 or less are small. The graphs
                to the right illustrate what effects of various sizes might look
                like - red dots are group means, and black dots are the
                individual measurements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can see that in the first panel, labeled "No.effect" there
                is no difference between the means, so with a numerator of 0 d
                is 0. Small, but non-zero, effects result from real,
                population-level differences in means between groups that are
                small compared with the amount of variability in the data. </p>
              <p>The next two graphs (Medium.Effect.1 and Medium.Effect.2) have
                the same effect size, even though the graphs look different. The
                difference between mean in Medium.Effect.1 is about twice as big
                as in Medium.Effect.2, but Medium.Effect.1 also has a standard
                deviation that's twice as big, so they both show the same number
                of standard deviations between means.<br>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The biggest effect sizes result from large differences between
                treatment groups compared with the random variation within each
                group. The Huge.Effect graph is an example with differences
                between means large enough that the data values don't overlap
                between the groups.</p>

      <p>Given what you know about how statistical testing is done, which effect
        size has the greatest chance of giving us a statistically significant
        result?</p>

      <div style="display:none;" id="eff_size_p">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Big effects are easier to
          detect statistically - as the difference in mean gets larger, the
          probability of obtaining a difference of that size goes down, and the
          p-value gets smaller.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a real
        experimental treatment effect is called "power", which is 1- Î² (with Î²
        being the probability of failing to detect a real difference - we
        encountered this earlier as the Type II statistical error). Since
        rejecting the null means to statistically "detect" the treatment effect,
        you can think of power as the probability of detecting a real treatment
        effect in an experiment. </p>

              <p>If we plot the power of a comparison between two means as a
                function of effect size, with a sample size of 10 per group, we
                get this <strong>power curve</strong>. It should be clear from
                this curve that real, but small, effects can easily escape
                detection. We consider an effect of 0.5 standard deviations to
                be moderate, but the probability of detecting an effect of size
                0.5 is below 0.2 for this sample size of 10. This means that
                even if the treatment does have a moderately large effect, with
                a sample size of 10 observations per group we would miss it over
                80% of the time. With a small effect size of 0.1 we have less
                than a 10% chance of detecting it with a sample size of 10.</p>

                increasing the sample size puts the line higher on the curve.
                So, for any given effect we are trying to detect, an increase in
                sample size increases our chances of detecting it.</p>
              <p>If you look at a large effect size of 1, the probability of
                detecting the effect goes from about 0.3 at a sample size of 5,

                Sample sizes of 20 or above gives us good power to detect an
                effect size of 1. For really big effect sizes, like 2, we have a
                probability of 0.8 of detecting the effect with a sample size of
                5, and probabilities in the upper 0.9 range for all the others.</p>

                size of 0.1 we still have only about a 10% chance of detecting
                the effect, even with a sample size of 100.</p>

      <p>So, even though sample size is an investigator's choice, and increasing
        sample size always helps increase power, be aware that collecting more
        data may not be enough if you are working with small to medium effect
        sizes. To the extent that it's possible to adopt experimental procedures
        that convert small effect sizes into large effect sizes, it's clearly in
        your best interests to do so.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="affect_effect">How do we affect effect size?</h3>
      <p>If effect size is a signal to noise ratio, our choices are to either <em><strong>
            boost the signal</strong></em> or <em><strong>reduce the noise</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>We do have some experimental control over the size of the signal -
        choice of treatment levels is a major determinant of the size of
        response we will get. In our plant growth example, you want to use
        enough fertilizer to produce a nice robust change in growth in the
        fertilized plants relative to the controls. However, there are limits to
        how far you can push this - if you want your results to pertain to the
        real world you can't use higher treatment levels than are likely to ever
        by used, and you don't want to use so much fertilizer that you over-dose
        the plants and kill them.</p>
      <p>We have more control over the noise component. One way to reduce the
        noise is to be careful in our measurements, because sloppiness adds to
        the random variation in our data. We can also reduce noise by holding as
        many factors constant as possible.</p>
      <p>But, you can also reduce the noise by using a block design, and by
        accounting for the block in your ANOVA. In an ANOVA, the error term is
        the measurement of noise in the data, so anything that reduces the size
        of the error term will make the effect size bigger. Extracting the
        variation due to greenhouse from the error term and putting it into the
        block effect therefore actually <em>increases the effect size for the
          fertilizer treatment</em>, without doing anything to increase the
        amount of growth that the fertilizer causes - in other words, using a
        block increases the treatment effect size by reducing the noise, without
        needing to change the size of the signal at all.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="exercise">Today's exercise</h2>
      <p>Today we will work with a simulation of an experiment, which tests for
        an effect of parasites on metabolic rate in mice. Since parasites
        potentially compete for food with the host, and actually may eat host
        intestinal tissue, it's expected that carrying a parasite load will
        impose a metabolic demand on the host. Mice would likely have to then
        increase their metabolic rate to meet the extra demand.</p>
      <p>Mice can be experimentally infected with intestinal parasites, and we
        will work with three different experimentally-induced infection levels
        (high, medium, or low) as our treatment variable. You will use a measure
        of metabolic rate as the response. </p>
      <p>Parasite treatment is the only variable of scientific interest in this
        study, but the experiment is also subject to several nuisance variables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strain - you have access to white mice, and to wild house mice.</li>
        <li>Sex - you can have male or female mice.</li>
        <li>Age - the mice are bred in captivity, and are of known age. You have
          access to juveniles, and to adults.</li>
        <li>Observer - these experiments are labor intensive and time consuming,
          and you're too busy being an internationally famous scientist to do
          the experiment yourself. You have three different helpers (Fred, Mary,
          and Jane) available to collect data.</li>
        <li>Chamber - three different climate-controlled chambers are available
          for housing the mice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your job is to design an experiment that will allow you to test for the
        effect of infection intensity on metabolic rate, while dealing with each
        of these confounding variables.</p>

          you can access here</a>. Clicking on the link will open the app in a
        separate window, so you can work with it while you read the
        instructions.</p>
      <p>For each nuisance variable, you choices are to hold it constant,
        randomize with respect to it, or block on it to measure its effect and
        statistically remove it from the test of the effects of parasite load.</p>
      <p>But, as in the real world, there are constraints on what you can do.</p>
      <h3>Variables you can treat however you like: age, sex, and strain</h3>
      <p>For these three variables, you are free to hold them constant (i.e. use
        only one age, one sex, and one strain), randomize (i.e. randomly assign
        mice to treatment groups without accounting for age, sex, or strain), or
        block on them (i.e. measure and account for them).</p>
      <h3>Variables for which your options are limited: observer and chamber</h3>
      <p>There is too much work for a single helper, so you must use at least
        two of them to get the work done. You can choose to randomly assign mice
        to all three of them to measure, or you can block on two or three of
        them, but you must use at least two.</p>
      <p>You have to keep the mice in climate-controlled chambers for the
        duration of the study, but you can't fit all of them in a single
        chamber. There are three chambers available, and you must use at least
        two. Just like with observer you can either randomly assign mice to all
        three of them, or block on two or three of them, but you must use at
        least two.</p>
      <h3>Choices that are not yours to make</h3>
      <p>You have to use all three of the parasite treatment levels (high,
        medium, and low).</p>
      <p>You are also constrained to use balanced, complete designs.
        Consequently, any variables you choose to block on (along with the
        parasite treatment variable) will be included in all possible
        combinations, with an equal number of mice in each combination. The app
        will take care of this for you.</p>
      <p>You are limited by time and money to a total of 48 mice. Since you are
        required to use balanced, complete blocks, if you (for example) block on
        two helpers and two chambers, with three treatment levels, you have 2 x
        2 x 3 = 12 different combinations. If you block on all three of the
        helpers and chambers you will have 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 different
        combinations. Blocking on these as well as sex of mouse gives you 2 x 3
        x 3 x 3 = 54 combinations, which is more combinations than you have
        mice. The sample size constraint will thus force you to make some
        choices - some of the nuisance variables will have to either be held
        constant or randomized.</p>
      <p>Mass affects metabolic rate, and parasite load can affect mass, so the
        mass of each animal at the end of the experiment will be provided to
        you. You will want to evaluate whether the effect of parasites is via a
        change in mass, or if parasites have metabolic effects in excess of any
        changes in mass that they cause.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="your_exp">Instructions for conducting your
        experiment:</h2>
      <p> 1. Conduct the experiment by setting the check boxes in the app to
        reflect your design, and then clicking "Do the experiment now". </p>
      <p>For strain, sex, and age:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>To randomize, leave both check boxes un-checked. Mice from both
            levels will be used, but they will be randomly selected and randomly
            assigned to treatment groups. Note that if you choose to randomize
            with respect to a nuisance variable the variable will appear in the
            data set so you can see how the randomization worked, but <em><strong>do
                not include it as a predictor when you analyze the data!!!! </strong></em>Randomizing
            a variable means to trust the randomization to prevent confounding,
            but without including the variable as a block in the analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To hold a variable constant, check the box next to the single level
            you wish to use. For example, if you wish to only use white mice,
            check "White", but not "Wild". The variable will be included in your
            final data set to remind you of your choice, but it will only have
            "White" mice - don't use variables containing only one level in your
            statistical analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To block on one of these factors, check both boxes. The variable
            will be included in the data set, in all possible combinations with
            the treatment and any other blocked variable, with equal numbers of
            mice in each combination. Be sure to include any factor you block on
            as a predictor in your ANOVA.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For observer and chamber:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to use all three levels randomly allocated, leave all
            un-checked (and don't include them as predictors in your ANOVA).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to use two or three levels and block on them, select
            the ones you want to use.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are <em><strong>required</strong></em> to select at least two
        observers and at least two chambers. The app won't prevent you from
        selecting only one, so make sure you select at least two to avoid point
        deductions on your assignment.</p>
      <p>Once you have the design specified, click "Do the experiment now". You
        will see a dataset with 48 records, that reflects the choices you made.
        If you do not get a table, you probably tried to block on too many
        factors (there are 2x2x2x3x3x3 = 216 possible combinations, so you can't
        block on everything). If you get no data in your table when you click
        "Do the experiment now", try un-checking some boxes and re-run.</p>
      <p>3. Download the data for import into R. Once you have the design you
        want, click "Click to download". You will be presented with a "save
        file" dialog, with a file called "my_data.csv" as the default file name.
        Put the file in a convenient location (a folder on your H: drive, for
        example). If you change the name, only change the part before .csv, as
        the file name extension identifies it as a "comma separated values" file
        to Windows.</p>
      <p>4. Start R Studio, make a new project in a folder called "design", and
        import your data file by typing this command in the R console:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code">design1 &lt;- read.csv(file.choose())</span></p>
      <p>A window will pop up that will allow you to go find the file, and
        select it for import. The file will be put into a data frame object
        called design1.</p>
      <p>5. Analyze the data. Minimally, the analysis you do should include:</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Graph the metabolic rate by parasite treatment. You will want a plot
          of means and error bars, but you need the factor levels to be in order
          of increasing parasite infection intensity, not in alphabetical order.</li>
        <li>Fit a model with metabolic rate as a response variable, and with
          Treatment and all of the variables you blocked on as predictors, but
          not including weight (<em>also, do not include variables you held
            constant or allowed to be randomized - they will be in your data
            set, but you are not to use them</em>).</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Obtain an ANOVA table, and determine whether parasite treatment
            had an effect on metabolic rate.</li>
          <li>Conduct post-hocs to test for differences between pairs of
            parasite treatment levels (instructions below***). Do this step even
            if Treatment isn't significant in your ANOVA table - it's a new
            skill that I want you to learn (but bear in mind you wouldn't do
            post-hocs without a significant omnibus test normally).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Determine whether parasite treatment is confounded with body weight.
          You will need to compare how Type I SS and Type II SS tests differ to
          find this out. If the entire effect of parasites on metabolic rate is
          due to changes in weight, then Treatment will only be significant if
          it's entered first in the model, using Type I SS in the ANOVA table.
          If Treatment is not significant in Type II tests, or if it's entered
          second in the model and tested with Type I SS ANOVA, then the effect
          of treatment is due to changes in weight.</li>
        <ul>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Fit a model in which weight is the first variable entered, and
            parasite treatment is the second, followed by the rest of your block
            variables.</li>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Fit a second model in which parasite treatment is entered first,
            followed by weight, followed by the rest of your block variables.</li>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Pick one of your fitted models and obtain a Type II ANOVA table.
            Obtain Type I ANOVA tables for each of the models. Use these to
            evaluate whether parasite treatment has an effect after weight has
            been accounted for.</li>
          <ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Save all of the output to a Word file, which you'll upload as a
        separate document when you submit the assignment for this project.</p>
      To get your Tukey post-hocs use the multcomp package. To help you
      remember, the steps will be first to load the library:
      <p class="rcmd"><span class="R-code">library(multcomp)</span> </p>
      <p>Then, enter the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">glht(metrate.lm, linfct = mcp(Treatment = "Tukey"))
          -&gt; for.comparisons</span></p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">summary(for.comparisons)</span></p>
      <p>and you'll get Tukey tests of pairs of means (be sure to change
        "metrate.lm" to match the name of your fitted model - R is case
        sensitive, so watch upper and lower case).</p>
      <p>You can get the compact letter display indicating which groups are
        significantly different using:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">cld(for.comparisons)</span></p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>6. Repeat the experiment 10 times. I have written another version of
        the app <a target="_blank" href="http://qandc.csusm.edu:3838/kristan_shiny_apps/design_take2/">here</a>
        that has all the same design options, but will select the data set, run
        the models for you, and report the Type I SS and Type II SS ANOVA
        tables. You can use this version of the app to repeat the experiment ten
        times - each time you hit "Do the experiment now" the experiment is run
        again with a different set of mice. </p>
      <p>Each time you repeat the experiment, record whether the parasite
        treatment or weight predictors are significant in each of the three
        ANOVA tables.</p>
      <p><em>Note that there is a download data button, but you don't need to
          download anything for this step if you don't want to - the ANOVA
          tables give you all the information you need.</em></p>
      <p>7. Write a short report (1-2 pages) that explains why you designed the
        experiment as you did, and how well it worked. Be sure to address the
        following:</p>
      <p>- How did you deal with each source of nuisance variation? Which ones
        did you hold constant, which did you randomly allocate to treatment
        levels, and which did you measure and account for statistically?</p>
      <p>- Did you detect a parasite effect in the first analysis you ran
        yourself, without weight included?</p>
      <p>- When you repeated the analysis ten times with the app, how often did
        you detect the parasite treatment effect? Did it matter whether whether
        parasite treatment was included first in the Type I tests? Was parasite
        treatment significant in the Type II tests? What does this tell you
        about how parasites affect metabolic rate?</p>
      <p>- What other predictors that you included might you expect to at least
        partially affect the weight of the animals? Did you see any differences
        in their effects with weight included or excluded?</p>
      <p>- Why might you want to block on a factor instead of holding it
        constant? Were any factors you blocked on significant?</p>
      <p>When you are done, upload your report and your output file to the
        course web site. Due in one week, 10/5 at the beginning of class.</p>
