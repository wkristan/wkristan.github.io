      <p class="part" id="intro"> Medicinal leeches are aquatic annelids that
        feed on warm-blooded prey, by attaching with their front suckers,
        abrading the skin with a rasp-like jaw, and drinking the blood as it
        seeps from the skin. Leeches are capable of consuming a huge amount of
        blood in a single feeding, several times their own body weights. After a
        feeding leeches rapidly expel the liquid portion of the blood, and then
        more slowly digest the solid components of their meal. As ectothermic
        animals, their metabolic rates are quite low, and a single blood meal
        can last them for months. </p>
      <p>Leeches can also be fooled into eating arginine solution, but arginine
        has little nutritive value for leeches. We will see whether leeches fed
        on arginine show a different pattern of weight change over time compared
        to leeches fed on blood. </p>
      <p>Multiple measurements from the same leech are probably not independent
        - a big leech is going to have consistently big masses compared with a
        small leech. We could handle this level of dependency by using the
        individual leech as a random effect.</p>
      <p>We also would expect to have some serial dependency, which means that
        measurements of the same leech between successive days will be
        correlated, particularly if the leech is gaining or losing weight over
        time. We can account for this serial dependency using repeated measures
        ANOVA. </p>
      Repeated measures analysis treats time as an ordinal categorical variable,
      so our analysis will be very much like a 2-way factorial ANOVA. Thus, we
      can ask questions about:
      <ol>
        <li> Whether there are differences in masses between arginine and
          blood-fed leeches - this is the between-subjects main effect.</li>
        <li> Whether masses changed over time - this is the within-subjects main
          effect.</li>
        <li> Whether the pattern of change over time differed between arginine
          and blood-fed leeches - this is the interaction of between- and
          within-subjects effects.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are two different approaches to repeated measures analysis - the
        univariate approach, and the multivariate approach. If your data meet
        the assumptions of univariate RMA it is more statistically powerful than
        the multivariate approach. However, to use the univariate approach we
        need to assume sphericity, which means that the variance has to be the
        same between successive time points. If we violate sphericity, but not
        too badly, we can adjust for the lack of sphericity within a univariate
        ANOVA. However, if we violate sphericity badly we would need to use the
        multivariate approach, which does not assume sphericity at all. </p>
      <p>We will focus on understanding the univariate approach today. We will
        use a data set that's derived from a real experiment, but has been
        altered by your instructor to meet the sphericity assumption.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="import">Importing the data and graphing the means</h3>
      <p> 1. <strong>Start a new project (in a folder called "repeated"), start
          a new R script, and import today's data</strong>. Download <a href="leech.xlsx">this
          file</a> and import the two worksheets - the first one (leech) has the
        data in the arrangement we need for running a repeated measures ANOVA,
        but the other (leeches_stacked) is better for graphing. Call the first
        data set leech, and the second leech.stacked.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Make a plot of means</strong>. Make a plot of mean weights,
        with "food" and "day" as the factors, and "weight" as the response.
        First, load ggplot2:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p>Make the summarized data set you need for plotting:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">leech.summ &lt;- summarySE(leech.stacked, measurevar =
        "weight", groups = c("day","food"))</p>
      <p>Next, set the global settings with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">leech.gg &lt;- ggplot(leech.summ, aes(x = day, y = mean,
        color = food, group = food, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se))</p>
      <p>Then add points, error bars, and lines to the plot:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">leech.gg + geom_point() + geom_line() +
        geom_errorbar(width = 0.1) + labs(y = "Weight")</p>
      <p>The final labs() statement changes the y-axis label from "mean" to
        "Weight".</p>
      <p>As expected, the leeches increase their body weight by a factor of 7-10
        when they feed, but you should also see that the blood-fed leeches only
        lose weight rapidly on the first day or two as they expel liquid from
        the blood, and then lose weight much more slowly after that as they
        slowly digest the solid components. The arginine-fed leeches appear to
        gain less weight, and to lose weight rapidly for several days in a row.
        Since the patterns are quite different you should expect a food x day
        interaction.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="rma">Repeated measures analysis</h2>
      <p>There are actually several different ways to run a univariate repeated
        measures analysis in R (that I know of, there may be more). They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Using aov() with an Error() statement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using Anova() from the car package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using ezANOVA() from the ez package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Using linear mixed effects models, from either the lme or lme4
          packages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will use the Anova() function from the car package, because it is
        flexible and comprehensive. Anova() gives us a test of sphericity, and
        provides univariate analysis with and without corrections for violation
        of sphericity, as well as multivariate tests if they are needed.</p>
      <p>The three that we aren't going to learn about today are also
        interesting - the ez package is designed as a set of "wrappers" that use
        existing R commands to do the actual work, but make the input from the
        user simpler and more intuitive (remember that script I gave you to test
        the effects of light at each of two water levels when you did the
        interaction exercise? That was a wrapper function). The linear mixed
        effects packages (lme and lme4) are the preferred platforms for fitting
        complex mixed-effects models in R. The reason we won't be using them is
        that they use a different syntax in their model statements, organize the
        output in an unfamiliar way, and generally are a much bigger departure
        from what you've already learned.</p>
      <p>There are several steps we need to take to use the Anova() function for
        repeated measures analysis.</p>
      <p>1. <strong>Prepare the data for analysis with Anova()</strong>. To use
        Anova() we need to provide it with several things: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>An object that defines the within-subjects design - it's possible
            to have treatment levels that we need to account for in the
            within-subjects part of the design. We could, for example, have kept
            the leeches in cold water for the first four days, and then
            increased the temperature for the last three, in which case
            temperature would be an additional within-subjects factor. In this
            case, since we have only one within-subjects variable (day) we have
            a very simple within-subjects design - all we need to do is list the
            time points. We will call this object "time.factor".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A "data frame" that gives names for the different repeated time
            points (which we will call "time.frame").</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A fitted lm() model that includes the between-subjects effect for
            each of the time points (which we will call "time.model"). This is
            actually a multivariate linear model, with all of the time points
            treated as a response, but Anova() will use the analysis to
            construct a univariate RMA from it.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> To set up the object that defines the different levels of the repeated
        factor, use:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="rcmd"> time.factor &lt;- ordered(seq(1,7))</span><br>
        <br>
        This command generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 7 and then makes
        an ordinal factor out of them (remember, in R "factor" is the name of a
        categorical variable made up of levels - making this an ordered factor
        will give us the ability to test for trends over time). We have seven
        days of measurements, and Anova() will use this object to label them.
        You won't see any output to the screen because the factor was assigned
        to time.factor, but if you type the name of the object its contents will
        be displayed:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7<br>
          Levels: 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7</span></p>
      <p>The levels are the category names, and R uses less than symbols to
        indicate the ordering. To make a data frame that gives names for the
        repeated time points use:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="rcmd"> time.frame &lt;- data.frame(time.factor)</span></p>
      <p>Time.frame has only the time.factor in it, but it is now a column in a
        data frame. The time.frame object is defining the within-subjects
        design, and since we only have a single within-subjects factor (time),
        we just need one column with the time points identified.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, to set up the model to be analyzed, use the commands:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="rcmd">time.bind &lt;- as.matrix(leech[,3:9])&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        </p>
      <p>This command extracts the masses in columns 3 through 9 and assigns
        them to a matrix called time.bind. To fit the model, use the command:<br>
        <br>
        <span class="rcmd">time.model &lt;- lm(time.bind ~ leech$food)<br>
        </span><br>
        This last command makes a multivariate linear model for the
        between-subjects factor (food), that also includes all of the basic
        quantities Anova() needs to do univariate repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Run the analysis</strong>. First, make sure the "car"
        library is loaded - it has the Anova() function we need:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">library(car)</span></p>
      <p>Generate the analysis with the commands:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">leech.rma &lt;- Anova(time.model, idata =
          time.frame, idesign = ~time.factor)</span></p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">summary(leech.rma)</span></p>
      <p>The first command, Anova(), produces the analysis and places the output
        into object leech.rma, and the second, summary(), dumps the output to
        the screen so you can see it.</p>
      <p>The Anova() command produces a lot of output, because both multivariate
        and univariate tests are produced. We are only interested in the
        univariate results for this class, so scroll down to the bottom and then
        back up until you see "Univariate Type II Repeated-Measures ANOVA
        Assuming Sphericity". It looks like this:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">Univariate Type II Repeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming

      <p>Each term tested (main effect of food, main effect of time, interaction
        between food and time) gets a row in the table, and the sums of squares
        and degrees of freedom used to generate a term's F value is all in the
        same row. This is different than we are used to - the ANOVA tables we
        have been working with had a different row for variation explained by a
        term, and put the error term in another row at the end of the table. In
        this repeated measures ANOVA table, the term's explained SS appears
        first, followed by the term's (numerator) df, followed by the error SS
        used to test the term, and the error (denominator) df. From these an F
        ratio and p-value are calculated.</p>
      <p>The main effect of food is tested relative to random variation among
        mean masses of the individual leeches. Because of this, you'll see the
        denominator Df is 18 for the test of leech$food, which is the number of
        leeches - 2. The main effect of time and the time by food interaction
        are both assessed using the repeated measurements, so the error term
        used to test time and time by food interaction is random variation at
        the level of individual measurements - the degrees of freedom of 108
        appearing&nbsp; is based on the number of measurements, rather than the
        number of leeches.</p>
      <p>Below this ANOVA table is Mauchly's test of sphericity - it looks like
        this:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">Mauchly Tests for Sphericity<br>

      <p>The epsilon statistic measures the degree of sphericity in the data,
        with an epsilon of 1 indicating perfect sphericity. If we fail the
        sphericity test but epsilon is still greater than 0.7, we can use
        p-values that adjust for the lack of sphericity. There are two different
        approaches to measuring epsilon and adjusting the p-value, developed by
        Greenhouse and Geisser or by Huynh and Feldt, and the epsilons and
        adjusted p-values for both are presented. We don't need these now, since
        we meet the sphericity assumption, but you might need them later (on an
        exam, in life). </p>
      <p>If we violated sphericity and our epsilon value was too small (&lt;
        0.7) to use the GG or HF corrections, we should use the multivariate
        tests instead. If you search through the mass of output, you'll find a
        table for each term in the model that looks like this (they aren't all
        together, but I've gathered them together to make it easier for you to
        see them):</p>

      <p>Each row is a different multivariate test statistic which all test the
        same question in a different way, and you would only need to present one
        for each term. You can see they all have identical p-values to eight
        decimal places, so the choice isn't critical in this case - Wilks is
        most commonly reported.</p>
      <p>To sum up, the procedure is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you meet the sphericity assumption according to Mauchly's test,
          use the un-adjusted p-values from the univariate ANOVA table.</li>
        <li>If you violate the sphericity assumption, look at the epsilon value
          to see how badly you violate it. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>With an epsilon above 0.7, use the GG or HF adjusted p-values for
            the within-subjects main effect and the between x within
            interaction.</li>
          <li>If epsilon is less than 0.7, use the multivariate tests. Wilks is
            commonly reported, so as long as all the multivariate tests agree,
            use Wilks.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="part" id="rma_posthocs">Post-hoc analysis of an RMA</h2>
      <p>Post-hoc comparisons in a repeated measures ANOVA can take several
        different forms, depending on what we want to know about the results. If
        there is <em><strong>no interaction</strong></em>, we can do the
        following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Between-subjects main effect - Tukey comparisons among treatment
            groups (if needed - with only two groups a significant main effect
            is all we need in our case).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Within-subjects main effect - post-hoc comparisons among time
            points of interest. Since the data are repeated measurements over
            time, paired comparisons should be used. We have 7 time points,
            which would give us 21 pairs of means to compare if we used all that
            were possible. This can be reduced if you are only interested in
            comparing one time point against all the others - for example, you
            may want to compare each time point against initial conditions, or
            against the final measurement to see when a difference arises, or
            when differences disappear, respectively. You may also be interested
            in differences between successive time points - day 1 to day 2, day
            2 to day 3, etc.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, we have an interaction, telling us that the pattern of change over
        time depends on the treatment. We still would like to avoid comparing
        all possible pairs of means, because with 7 time points and 2 food
        groups there are 91 possible pairs of food types and time points to
        compare. A more restricted, targeted set of comparisons is needed.</p>
      <p>The choice of which comparisons to make depends largely on your
        research question, but there are a couple of common approaches:</p>
      <p><strong>Tests of trend over time</strong>: rather than testing for
        differences between means, you may be happy to just know what the nature
        of the change over time is.</p>
      <p>This unfortunately is not perfectly straightforward - car library
        includes a function called linearHypothesis() that lets us test for
        different time trends (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We will just test the trends for the main effect of time. First, we
        need to create the "model matrix" that has the orthogonal polynomial
        weights (remember, these take the place of dummy codes for ordered
        factors, and model the different time levels as a linear trend + a
        quadratic trend + a cubic trend...up to one less than the number of
        factor levels). Do that with the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">model.matrix(~time.factor) -&gt; time.model.matrix</span></p>
      <p>If you type the name of the object, time.model.matrix, you'll see a
        matrix with a column for an intercept, and then columns with
        coefficients for each type of trend - rows are the seven days.</p>
      <p>To test the linear trend in the data, we would use the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">linearHypothesis(time.model, "(Intercept) = 0",
          P=time.model.matrix[ , 2, drop=FALSE])</span></p>
      This command uses the time.model object we already created for Anova() -
      time.model is the within-subjects design of the analysis. Our polynomial
      weights are centered on 0, so testing if the intercept is equal to 0 is
      equivalent to testing the trend. The argument P=time.model.matrix[ , 2,
      drop=FALSE] tells linearHypothesis() to use the second column in our
      time.model.matrix in the hypothesis test. The second column is where the
      linear weights are, so this will test for linear trend. To test for
      quadratic trend, you can just recall the command (with the up arrow key),
      and change the 2 to a 3 in time.model.matrix[ , 3, drop = FALSE].
      <p><strong>Comparisons between groups at each time point:</strong> If
        finding the time points at which the treatments differ is important we
        can compare the food treatments at each day. Since no comparisons are
        made between days we will only have 7 comparisons to do.</p>
      <p>R actually makes this pretty easy - we can use the aov() command to
        conduct an ANOVA for all 7 of the daily mass measurements with a single
        command. Comparison of foods within a time point is a comparison between
        two independent groups, so paired comparisons aren't needed, and with
        only two food levels we can use the p-value on an ANOVA to tell if the
        treatments are different. Use the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd"> summary(aov(time.bind~food, data=leech))</span></p>
      <p> This assumes you used time.bind for your Anova() of the actual data;
        if not, change time.bind to be the name you used for the set of masses
        in the real data set. You will get a separate ANOVA table for each set
        of masses in time.bind. Bear in mind that with 7 tests you should not
        consider anything greater than 0.05/7 = 0.0071 to be significant.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Comparison between time points within each group:</strong>
        Finally, we might want to know which time points are different within a
        food type.</p>
      <p>We may only be interested in comparing sequential differences (that is,
        differences between d1 to d2, d2 to d3, d3 to d4, etc.) for blood-fed
        animals, and the same sequence for arginine-fed animals. Alternatively,
        we may be interested in the time points that are different than starting
        conditions - each of the time points compared to d1. In either case we
        need these comparisons to be paired t-tests instead of ANOVA's or
        two-sample t-tests because we're comparing two sets of measurements on
        the same individuals on different days.</p>
      <p>R provides a function called pairwise.t.test() that can make the
        comparisons we want, using paired t-tests. It has one big drawback,
        though, in that it only presents "naked" p-values - meaning, p-values
        without test statistics and degrees of freedom, which is not usually
        enough to satisfy editors of journals. We will use a process that will
        give us what we want, but it will take a couple of steps.</p>
      <p>1. <strong>Calculate the differences between sequential time points</strong>.
        The data are in an object called leech, with the leech at each day in
        columns 3 through 9. We can calculate differences between successive
        time points with:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">leech[,3:8] - leech[,4:9] -&gt; time.diffs</span></p>
      <p>Since the column references are all different by 1, this command will
        subtract column 4 from 3, column 5 from 4, and so on. We can make these
        differences a data frame, with the command: </p>
      <p> <span class="rcmd">data.frame(time.diffs) -&gt; time.diffs</span></p>
      <p>If you look at time.diffs (by typing time.diffs at the command prompt)
        you'll see that the labels are carried over from the first set of
        columns - they are the labels for the first through the 6th day, rather
        than labels that indicate the difference. We can fix this by assigning
        labels that indicate the two days being compared:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">colnames(time.diffs) &lt;-
          paste(colnames(leech[,3:8]), colnames(leech[,4:9]), sep = ".")</span></p>
      <p>The paste() command combines arguments together, using the separator
        identified with sep =. We are using the column names for columns 3 to 8,
        and combining them in pairs with the column names in 4 to 9, using a
        period as the separator. This will help us keep track of what is being
        compared as we assemble our results.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Split the data by food type</strong>. We want to split the
        data in two by food group, which we can do with: </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">split(time.diffs, leech$food) -&gt; diffs.split</span></p>
      <p>The split() command takes a data frame we want to split, and a factor
        that has the groups we want to split by, and makes a list with data sets
        for each of the groups. A list is another R data type, which has named
        elements that can hold another data type (a data frame, or a matrix, for
        example). If you type the name:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">diffs.split</span></p>
      <p>you will see you have two named sections, one for $blood, and one for
        $arg, with the differences for each. You can extract a named element by
        name using the syntax:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">diffs.split$arg</span></p>
      <p>to get the arginine differences as a group. To pull out just the
        differences for d1.d2, you would change this to:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">diffs.split$arg$d1.d2</span></p>
      <p>3. <strong>Conduct the paired t-tests</strong>. Now that we have a
        list with our two data sets, we can get our t-tests done using a single
        command that applies a function to each named element of a list. Use the
        command: </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">lapply(diffs.split, function(i) apply(i, MARGIN = 2,
          FUN = t.test)) -&gt; diffs.ttests</span></p>
      <p>This is actually two different versions of the apply function nested
        inside of one another. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The outer function is lapply(), and this is used to extract the data
          from each named element of diffs.split one at a time and apply a
          function to them. The first argument is the name of the list
          (diffs.split). From this list, lapply() extracts the first named
          element ($arg) passes it to the function specified as the second
          argument. The function is specified as function(i) apply(). At this
          point, control is passed to the apply() function.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>apply() is used to apply a function (identified by FUN =) to
            either the rows (if MARGIN = 1) or columns (if MARGIN = 2) of a data
            frame or a matrix. Our differences between days are in columns, so
            we're using MARGIN = 2. The first time through the apply() function
            will pass the differences in diffs.split$arg$d1.d2 to the function
            specified by FUN.</li>
          <li>The FUN = t.test statement causes the function
            t.test(diffs.split$arg$d1.d2) to be run. Running t.test() on a
            single set of data without any other arguments gives us a one-sample
            t-test of the mean of d1.d2 against 0. A one-sample comparison of
            differences against a hypothetical mean difference of 0 is a paired
            t-test, so this will give us paired t-tests of the differences
            between successive days.</li>
          <li>apply() then moves to the next column, d2.d3, and performs a
            t-test on it. This continues until all of the columns in
            diffs.split$arg are processed, at which time apply() passes control
            back to the lapply() function.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>lapply() moves to the second named element, $blood, and passes it
          back to apply(). When apply() completes the t-tests for all the
          columns of differences in $blood, and the complete set of t-test
          results are returned and put into diffs.ttests.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>4. <strong>Report the results</strong>. If you look at the output by
        typing:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">diffs.ttests</span></p>
      <p>you'll see that diffs.ttests is a list of t-tests, each labeled by the
        food type first, and then by the day. For example, the label $arg$d1.d2
        is labeled first by the food type, and then by the days being compared.
        The labeling is hierarchical - meaning, if we used the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">diffs.ttests$arg</span></p>
      <p>we get all of the t-tests done on the arginine-fed leeches, with labels
        giving only the days compared.</p>
      <p>It's a long list, but if you were patient and careful you could record
        each p-value, test statistic, and degrees of freedom for all of the
        tests.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there is a better way. </p>
      <p>First, you should understand that the output of a t-test is also an R
        object made up of several named elements. We can see what they are for
        the arginine d1.d2 t-test by typing:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">names(diffs.ttests$arg$d1.d2)</span></p>
      <p>You'll see the following:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">[1] "statistic"&nbsp;&nbsp; "parameter"&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "p.value"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "conf.int"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "estimate"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          [6] "null.value"&nbsp; "alternative"
          "method"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "data.name" </span></p>
      <p>We don't need all of these values, we only need the test statistic,
        degrees of freedom, and p-value, which are the named elements
        "statistic", "parameter", and "p.value". To extract p-values from the
        list of tests, we would use: </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.ttests, function(i) sapply(i,
          function(y) y$p.value)) -&gt; pvals<br>
        </span></p>
      <p>The sapply() function is just like lapply(), but it returns a matrix
        instead of a list. This command is actually two sapply() functions
        nested inside one another, and it works like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The outer sapply() uses diffs.ttests as its first argument, and
          extracts all of $arg results first to pass to the function defined in
          its second argument. The function(i) statement says that the data
          passed on to the function is going to be called i within the function
          definition. The function that is defined is another sapply(), and this
          second sapply() uses i as its first argument, which will be the $arg
          t-tests for the first time through. The $arg t-tests are thus passed
          to the inner sapply() function.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The inner sapply() takes the data passed to it in i, and then
            applies a function to the first named section within i, which will
            be d1.d2. The named sections used for the inner sapply() are called
            y.</li>
          <li>The function defined in the inner sapply() simply extracts the
            p-value from the t-test result it is passed as y. The first time
            through the inner sapply, y will thus be the t-test for d1.d2.</li>
          <li>The inner sapply() moves on to the next t-test result (d2.d3), and
            extracts its p-value. This continues until all the t-tests in $arg
            have been processed.</li>
          <li>When all the t-tests in $arg have been processed, the inner
            sapply(), passes control back to the outer sapply().</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The outer sapply() moves on to the second named element, $blood, and
          repeats the process with the $blood t-tests.</li>
        <li>Once the $blood p-values have been extracted, the outer sapply()
          returns the p-values for both $arg and $blood. These are assigned to
          an object called pvals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you type pvals at the command line, you'll see a matrix of p-values,
        with row labels indicating the days being compared, and column labels
        indicating the food type.</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      Similarly, the test statistics can be obtained with:
      <p><span class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.ttests, function(i) sapply(i,
          function(y) y$statistic)) -&gt; tstats<br>
        </span></p>
      <p>And, the degrees of freedom can be obtained with:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">sapply(diffs.ttests, function(i) sapply(i,
          function(y) y$parameter)) -&gt; dfs<br>
        </span></p>
      <p>To combine all of these statistics in a single data frame, you can use:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">data.frame(p = pvals, t = tstats, df = dfs)</span></p>
      <p>The row labels show the comparison, and the column labels identify the
        statistic - R automatically appended arg or blood to the t, df, and p
        column names because data frames can't have two columns with identical
        names.</p>
      <p>You can change the ordering of the columns if you want to put the
        arginine and blood stats together. First put the comparisons into an
        object:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">data.frame(p = pvals, t = tstats, df = dfs) -&gt;
          ttest.results</span> </p>
      <p>Then to re-order the columns you just need to use the command:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">ttest.results[ , c(1,3,5,2,4,6)]</span></p>
      <p>This command is just the name of the ttest.results object, with square
        brackets used to refer to the rows and columns it contains. The first
        entry is the row identifier, and leaving it blank gives us all of the
        rows. The second entry is the column identifier, and using
        c(1,3,5,2,4,6) specifies the ordering of the columns to be reported.</p>
      <p>If you want to challenge yourself... try modifying this procedure to
        compare each subsequent day to day 1. This is the kind of comparison you
        would do if your first measurement was of initial conditions, and you
        wanted to identify the point at which conditions because different from
        the starting point.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="rma_components">Variance components</h2>
      <p>We have two different levels of random variation in this analysis:
        random variation among leeches, and random variation of measurements
        within a leech. We can estimate the variance components for these two
        different levels using our repeated measures ANOVA, but we would have to
        do several calculations by hand.</p>
      <p>We can use the aov() function to do the analysis, which will give us
        the MS terms we need. We have a complication, though: this is a
        mixed-effects model (with a fixed effect and a random effect), and there
        is an interaction between the fixed and random effects. The expected
        mean squares are:</p>

      <p>You can see that we have random variation due to <strong>leech</strong>,
        the <strong>time x leech</strong> interaction, and <strong>error</strong>.
        To estimate each of these, we need to isolate each of these terms.</p>
      <p>See if you can figure out each one:</p>

      <p>1. <strong>Run a repeated measures analysis with aov()</strong>. </p>
      <p>The aov() command allows us to do ANOVA with more than one level of
        random variation. We will need to use the stacked version of the data
        that you put together for your graphs, like so:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd"><strong></strong>leech.aov &lt;-&nbsp; aov(weight ~
          food * day + Error(leech.id), data=leech.stacked)</span></p>
      <p>This command models mass as a function of food treatment and day,
        including an interaction between them. The Error() statement tells aov()
        to treat leech.id as a source of random variation. The aov() command can
        determine from the fact that each leech ID is only found within blood or
        within arginine that food is a between-subjects factor. It can also see
        that each leech ID has measurements for each day, making day a
        within-subjects factor. The ANOVA table, when we ask for it, will test
        the food effect over leech.id as the error term, and will test both food
        and the food*day interaction over the error term.</p>
      <p>You have yet to see output - to get it, type:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">summary(leech.aov)</span></p>
      <p>You will see a split ANOVA table, grouped by the error term used as the
        denominator in the F tests, like this:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">Error: leech.id<br>

          401.3&nbsp;&nbsp; 66.89&nbsp; 34.349&nbsp; &lt; 2e-16 ***<br>
          food:day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; 71.4&nbsp;&nbsp;
          11.89&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.107 1.55e-05 ***<br>
          Residuals 108&nbsp; 210.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          1.95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span></p>
      <p>The table is subdivided by the error term used - the upper table with
        Error: leech.id uses random variation among leeches as its error term.
        This means that the Residuals Mean Sq term is the MS leech term. The
        Error: Within uses variability among measurements within food type and
        day combinations, which means that the Residuals Mean Sq in this table
        is the MS error term.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Calculate variance components for the random effects</strong>.
        If you recall from lecture, the MS for leech.id includes both random
        variation among leeches and among individual observations, so we need to
        calculate the variance component for leech.id. The formula is on your
        worksheet, and it's the residual MS for the "Error: leech.id" part of
        the table minus the residual MS from the "Error: Within" part, divided
        by the number of measures per leech (7). </p>
      <p> The residual MS for "Error: Within" is already the error variance
        component, so you can just report it to your worksheet.</p>
      <p>The change to the data I made to meet the sphericity assumption
        effectively removed the effect of individual leech from the data, so
        you'll see that you get a negative variance component. This is not a
        possible number (variances have to be positive), but it can happen when
        one of the variance components is very near zero. Usually small negative
        estimates are set to 0 - so, you can interpret this as telling you that
        all of the random variation is at the level of individual measurements,
        and none is due to variation among averages by leech.</p>
      <p>The actual data set (that badly fails sphericity) doesn't show this
        pattern. As a demonstration of a more typical situation, the ANOVA table
        for the actual data is here:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">Error: leech.id<br>

          Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          Residuals 108&nbsp;&nbsp; 35.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.33 </span></p>
      <p>The variance component for leech in the actual data is (8.9-0.33)/7 =
        1.22</p>
      <p>With a variance component for variation among individual data values of
        0.33, random variation among leeches is about 3.7 times greater than
        random variation among individual measurements.</p>
