      <p id="Intro" class="part">So far we have seen how to use GLM to model
        effects of categorical predictors (<strong>ANOVA</strong>) and numeric
        predictors (<strong>regression</strong>). We have also seen that it's
        easy to extend the GLM to model more than one numeric predictor (<strong>multiple
          regression</strong>). Since it's possible to model either categorical
        or numeric variables with a GLM, and to use more than one predictor at a
        time, it stands to reason that we should be able to use two predictors
        in the same model, one of which is categorical and the other of which is
        numeric. A model like this with a mix of categorical and numeric
        predictors is called <strong>Analysis of Covariance</strong>, or <strong>ANCOVA</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>We usually mix categorical and linear predictors for one of three
        reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The regression is the scientifically important thing, but there is
            a grouping in the data that needs to be accounted for. We may need
            to account for a categorical nuisance variable (greenhouse, growth
            chamber), or a characteristic of our study organisms (species, sex,
            age class).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Comparison among categorical treatment group levels is the
            scientifically important thing, but there is a continuous variable
            that adds noise to the data that needs to be statistically
            eliminated. Examples like this often use a measure of initial
            conditions as a covariate (e.g. initial bacterial density, initial
            weights of mice, etc.) to compensate for inability to hold all
            variables constant.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Comparison among treatment group levels is the important thing, but
            we need to use a covariate to adjust the size of the difference
            between the means to obtain a more reasonable comparison. A classic
            example of this type of analysis is mass-adjusting some feature of
            interest - using mass as a covariate compensates for our inability
            to set every individual to the same mass experimentally.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The model that we would use is the same in all three cases - we would
        have a numeric response explained by two predictors, one that is numeric
        and another that is categorical. The only difference would be in the
        part of the results on which we focus our attention.</p>
      <img alt="Silhouettes" src="rt_ch_ss.jpg" style="float: right; border: 1px solid; margin-left: 10px">
      <p>Our focus today will be on comparison of wing spans and tail lengths of
        three species of birds of prey, red-tailed hawks (RT), Cooper's hawks
        (CH), and sharp-shinned hawks (SS), shown in the image to the right. A
        summary table of the weights (g), wing chord (which measures the length
        of the longest primary feather to the wrist, and is a standard measure
        of wing size, in mm), and tail lengths (mm) of these species shows us
        the following:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp; Species Weight&nbsp; Wing&nbsp; Tail<br>
        1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CH&nbsp; 415.6 243.7 202.6<br>
        2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RT 1098.8 386.3 222.8<br>
        3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SS&nbsp; 140.1 183.4 145.5</p>
      <p>RT are by far the biggest bird in the picture, and not surprisingly RT
        have the largest means on all three of these variables - big birds have
        big parts. However, you can see in the picture that RT are shaped very
        differently than the other two species. RT are in the group of hawks
        called the buteos, which hunt ground-based prey, usually either from a
        perch or while soaring (soaring is a style of flight in which the wings
        are held outstretched without flapping, and the birds stay aloft by
        riding updrafts). In contrast, both CH and SS are accipiters, which hunt
        by chasing down smaller birds, usually through dense vegetation. RT need
        to have wings and tails that are well suited to soaring, whereas the CH
        and SS need to be highly maneuverable. It appears that CH and SS have
        longer tails <em>for their body sizes</em> than RT. The wings of the
        accipiters seem to smaller than RT for their sizes, but the amount of
        difference is difficult to judge given the differences in overall size
        of the species - or, to put it in statistical terms, comparison of
        shapes of the birds is confounded with differences in size.</p>
      <p>So, how do we make a comparison of the shapes of the species with
        respect to their wing and tail dimensions that accounts for the
        differences in their overall sizes?</p>
      <p>The first thing we should do is define weight as a simple measure of
        size.<strong></strong> As you learned in the experimental design
        activity, the ideal way to eliminate the confounding effects of a
        variable is to hold it constant experimentally, but here our measure of
        size is weight, and even if we could find some RT, CH, and SS that were
        all the same weight they would probably not be normal animals (the RT
        would be emaciated, and the CH and SS would be obese). When we can't set
        all of the subjects to the same value for a confounding variable the
        next best thing is to include the confounding variable in the model as a
        predictor, to account for its effects - this has the statistical effect
        of setting all of the species to the same mean weight, so that the
        differences in wing span and tail length can be compared between the
        species as though they all had the same weight. In other words, we will
        correct for the differences in size, so that we can focus on which
        species have the longest wing spans or tail lengths for their size. </p>
      <div style="clear: both"> <img alt="Lots of red tails" src="size_only.jpg"
          style="float: right; border: 1px solid">
        <h3>Possible outcomes</h3>
        <p>One possibility is that, despite the impression the picture above
          gives us, the hawks differ only in size but are the same shape. If
          this is the case then all three of the hawk species are essentially
          the same model that is scaled to different sizes. If that were the
          case, then the wing chords would look like the figure to the right,
          which shows the red-tailed hawk silhouette magnified to different
          sizes.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear: both"> <br>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both"> <img alt="Scale models" src="one_line.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid">
        <p>If raptors were all just different magnifications of the same basic
          model, a regression of wing vs. body would look like the illustration
          to the right. A single line with a single intercept is fitted through
          all three of the species, and it fits well. If we adjusted for body
          mass by calculating the wing chords of each species at the same mass,
          this would be like sliding the RT and SS points along the line such
          that their mean body masses are the same as the CH in the middle, and
          all three would all have the same mass-adjusted wing chords.</p>
        <p>So, what would a GLM that included body size and species as
          predictors show if this is the outcome? Body size is explaining the
          wing chord well, and we don't need lines with different intercepts to
          explain the scaling relationship. Adding species as a categorical
          predictor only helps if we need different intercepts, so including
          species as a predictor would not be expected to improve the fit -
          species would not be a significant predictor as long as body size was
          also included.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear: both"> <br>
      </div>
      <div> <img title="Parallel lines" alt="Parallel lines" src="parallel_lines.png"
          style="float: right; border: 1px solid">
        <p>But, if raptors aren't just different magnifications of the same
          basic model, we might expect a similar amount of increase in wing
          chord with increasing body size, but each species might have a
          different baseline size depending on whether they are adapted for
          soaring or maneuverability. If this is true a set of parallel lines
          would describe the data well, like the graph to the right.</p>
        <p>A linear model that includes both species and body size would fit
          better here than one that only included body mass. We would expect
          both species and body mass to be significant if we included them both
          in the GLM. The vertical distance between the lines at any given body
          mass is the mass-adjusted difference in wing span.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So, for today, we will analyze the differences between these three
        species of raptor in their mass-adjusted wing chords, and in their
        mass-adjusted tail lengths. If we find that the species categorical
        variable is significant, then we'll conclude that the species are not
        just different scales of the same model - that is, they have different
        shapes, and not just different sizes. Once we have established that
        there is a difference between the species, we can also use our model to
        estimate wing chords and body lengths of all the species at a common
        size.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="size_corr">Analyze size-corrected differences in wing
        chord and body length. </h2>
      <p>1. The data set you will analyze is <a href="hawks.xlsx">here</a>.
        Download the <a href="ancova.Rmd">Rmd</a> file into the project folder
        as well. Make a new project in R Studio called "ancova", and then
        download and import the data into a data frame called "hawks".</p>
      <p>If you open the hawks dataset and look it over, you'll see that there
        are columns for Species, Weight, Wing, and Tail, as well as some columns
        indicating the date that the bird was captured and measured, and its age
        and sex. We won't be using age or sex in this analysis, so the only
        categorical variable we will have is Species. We should convert Species
        to a factor (in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>, just below your import
        command): </p>
      <p class="rcmd">hawks$Species &lt;- factor(hawks$Species)</p>
      <p> 2. Now we are going to look at the data. First you need to load the
        ggplot2 library (in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p>The first part of a ggplot() command establishes the "aesthetic
        mappings" for variables (that is, the roles they're assigned to) (in
        your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species,
        group = Species))</p>
      <p>We will be plotting data from the hawks data frame, with Weight on the
        x-axis, Wing on the y-axis, and Species used for grouping and color
        coding.</p>
      <p>To get a scatter plot with points colored by species we have to add
        geom_point() to the end of the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species,
        group = Species)) + geom_point()</p>
      <p>You may at this point notice that the points for each species don't all
        seem to be lying along the same line. An ANCOVA fits a set of parallel
        lines to the data, which means that a single slope will be used but with
        different intercepts. These data seem to have both different slopes and
        intercepts. We can check our impression by adding the regression lines
        for each species' data using geom_smooth() - add this after
        geom_point():</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species,
        group = Species)) + geom_point(size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm",
        se = F)</p>
      <p> This adds a straight line to each species' data - by making the points
        smaller you can see the lines better, and you'll see that they don't all
        seem to have the same slope. This is not surprising, because scaling of
        body parts is often <strong>allometric</strong>, meaning that the parts
        change at different rates. Weight is a volumetric property - the bigger
        the volume of the animal the heavier it will be - and for any change in
        a linear dimension the volume increases roughly to that amount cubed.</p>
      <p>We can potentially straighten out those lines by plotting axes on a log
        scale - the log of a number is the exponent needed to raise a base to
        equal the number. If we use log base 10, then the logs are the exponent
        needed to raise 10 to equal the number (the log base 10 of 10 is 1, of
        100 is 2, of 1000 is 3, and so on). We can set an axis to use a log
        scale in ggplot with by adding scale_x_log10() or scale_y_log10() to our
        command. Let's set the x-axis to a log scale first to see if that's
        enough:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species,
        group = Species)) + geom_point(size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm",
        se = F) + scale_x_log10()</p>
      <p>You'll see that CH and SS seem to have the same slope, but RT still do
        not, so let's set the y-axis to a log scale as well:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species,
        group = Species)) + geom_point(size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm",
        se = F) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()</p>
      <p>This time the three lines seem to be more or less sharing the same
        slope, but to each have different intercepts - when we run our ANCOVA we
        will want to use the log of wing chord and the log of weight so that our
        ANCOVA model fits the data well.</p>
      <p>We can specify a log scale on graph axes easily enough, but if we are
        going to use the log of wing chord and the log of weight as our
        variables it's convenient to make log-transformed versions of them. The
        statistical results will be the same whether we use the log base 10 or
        natural logs (which are logs for the base e, which is an irrational
        constant equal to 2.178 for the first three decimal places). In R the
        log() function is for natural logs, and log10() is for log base 10.
        We'll go ahead and use natural logs - in your <strong>Rmd</strong> file
        enter:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">hawks$log.wing &lt;- log(hawks$Wing)<br>
        hawks$log.weight &lt;- log(hawks$Weight)</p>
      <p>Your hawks dataset should now have 11 variables, the last two of which
        are log.wing and log.weight<br>
      </p>
      <p>3. Fit a linear model with log wing chord as the response variable,
        using log of mass and species as predictors (in that order). Call the
        model "wing.lm" (for "wing chord linear model") - in your <strong>Rmd
          file</strong> enter:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(log.wing ~ log.weight + Species, data = hawks) -&gt;
        wing.lm</p>
      <p>To see what is in this lm object, type its name below this line and run
        the code chunk - you should see:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call:<br>
        lm(formula = log.wing ~ log.weight + Species, data = hawks)<br>
        <br>
        Coefficients:<br>
        (Intercept)&nbsp;&nbsp; log.weight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        SpeciesRT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpeciesSS&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.907536&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        0.263949&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.202391&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        0.006265&nbsp; </p>
      <p>All that is displayed here is the call (which reproduces the command
        used), and the coefficients for each term. The intercept is the
        predicted log.wing for Cooper's hawks with log.weight of 0 - how did we
        know this? By definition, and intercept is the value of the response
        when all of the predictors are set to 0 - when SpeciesRT and SpeciesSS
        are both set to zero the bird is a CH, so the intercept is the expected
        log.wing for a CH with log.weight of 0.</p>
      <p>4. To get our ANOVA table for the model, use (in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(wing.lm)</p>
      <p>You'll see that log.weight is a significant predictor, as is Species.
        This is a case in which we are trying to adjust for the effect of weight
        as a confounded, nuisance variable - the fact that log.weight is
        statistically significant gives us reason to think it was a good idea to
        account for it, but we don't really have much to interpret (yes, bigger
        birds have bigger wings, but we know that).</p>
      <p>The effect of Species is of more interest - there are significant
        differences between at least two of the species, but we can't tell which
        from the ANOVA table. We can do Tukey comparisons to see which are
        different from which, and we would like to get predicted log wing chords
        for the species at the same log weight, so that we can compare them.
        This will be mass-adjusted, <strong>least squares means</strong>.</p>
      <p>Let's do our Tukey comparisons and get a table of least squares means
        next.</p>
      <p>5. We can get Tukey post-hocs for the differences between mass-adjusted
        means for species using the emmeans library (in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(emmeans)<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">emmeans(wing.lm, tukey ~ Species)<br>
        </span></p>
      <p>There are two parts to the output - first there is an $emmeans block
        that looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Show in New Window<br>
        $emmeans<br>
        &nbsp;Species emmean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df
        lower.CL upper.CL<br>
        &nbsp;CH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.575 0.006082
        858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.563&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.587<br>
        &nbsp;RT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.778 0.005104
        858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.768&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.788<br>
        &nbsp;SS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.582 0.010419
        858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.561&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.602<br>
        <br>
        Confidence level used: 0.95 </p>
      <p>These are the expected marginal means (a.k.a. the least squares means)
        for wing span, calculated at the mean log weight. Calculating the least
        squares means at the mean of the covariate is a good choice, because it
        is where the standard errors will typically be smallest. You can see
        that RT still have the largest wing span (5.778) after adjusting for
        mass.</p>
      <p>Whether the differences between the species should be interpreted
        depends on whether the Tukey comparisons are significant - those
        comparisons are in the next block, and look like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">$contrasts<br>
        &nbsp;contrast estimate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df
        t.ratio p.value<br>

        &lt;.0001<br>
        <br>
        P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates </p>
      <p>The comparisons reported are between the mean log of wing chord for
        each species, adjusted for mass. Based on these results you'll see that
        the buteo (RT) is different from the two accipiters (CH and SS), but the
        two accipiters are not different from one another. This isn't too
        surprising, since the two accipiters look to be very similar in shape,
        but differ in size, such that once the size difference has been
        accounted for there isn't really any difference left between the
        accipiters.</p>
      <p>6. The choice to get least squares means at the mean of weight is a
        good one, but is it really the best one? We can compare the amount of
        difference between the&nbsp; We want predicted wing chords for each
        Species, so the first thing we need is a variable called Species with
        one row for each species - we can get this with (in the wing.lsmeans
        chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(Species = levels(hawks$Species), weight = 0)
        -&gt; for.predict</p>
      <p>This first command makes a new data frame with one row for each
        Species, and with 0 as the log.weight for all of them. The new data
        frame is assigned to a new object called for.predict.</p>
      <p>To get predicted log.wing for these three species at a log.weight of 0,
        use (in the same wing.lsmeans chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(predict(wing.lm, for.predict, se = T))</p>
      <p>You will see:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        fit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; se.fit&nbsp; df residual.scale<br>
        1 3.907536 0.04301618 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877<br>
        2 4.109927 0.04965137 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877<br>
        3 3.913801 0.03487755 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877</p>
      <p>These are not the same numbers you got with emmeans(), but the amount
        of difference between them is the same - the difference between CH and
        RT is 0.2, and between SS and RT is 0.2, but between SS and CH is less
        than 0.01. The standard errors are, however, a little bigger, because
        we're predicting the least squares mean at a value of log.weight that
        has a wider standard error (remember, confidence bands around regression
        lines are narrowest at the mean of x and mean of y, and get bigger as
        you move to larger or smaller values of x).</p>
      <p>To confirm that the emmeans() estimates are done at the mean of
        log.weight, change the values in the log.weight column of for.predict to
        be equal to the mean of log.weight from the hawks data (in your <strong>Rmd
          file</strong>, same code chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">for.predict$log.weight &lt;- mean(hawks$log.weight)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(predict(wing.lm, for.predict, se = T))</p>
      <p>You'll see that the fit column matches the emmean column, se.fit is the
        same as SE, and the df are the same.</p>
      <p>Finally, to see what the differences would be for Kaiju sized hawks by
        setting log.weight to 1000 (in the <strong>Rmd file</strong>, same
        chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">for.predict$log.weight &lt;- 1000</p>
      <p>and repeating the prediction (same chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(predict(wing.lm, for.predict. se = T))</p>
      <p>and you will get:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fit&nbsp;&nbsp;
        se.fit&nbsp; df residual.scale<br>
        1 267.8561 7.054525 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877<br>
        2 268.0585 7.047545 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877<br>
        3 267.8624 7.062390 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04242877</p>
      <p>The amount of difference between the least-squares means is still 0.2
        between the accipiters and RT, and around 0.01 between SS and CH. What
        is different, in addition to the massive predicted wing chords, is that
        the standard errors are much larger. Regression estimates are most
        precise close to the mean of the x-data and the mean of the y-data,
        because they are not affected by error in the estimate of the slope
        there. </p>
      <p>6. To plot the model, we can use the emmeans library's emmip() command
        - this is short for "expected marginal mean interaction plot" - in the <strong>console</strong>
        type<strong></strong>:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmip(wing.lm, Species ~ log.weight, cov.reduce = range)</p>
      <p>Your graph will look like this:</p>
      <img alt="The target" src="ancova_with_lines.png"></div>
    <p>This graph is fine, but it doesn't show the data points - we should only
      interpret the model if it fits the data well, and plotting the data on the
      graph helps us confirm that the fit is good. Fortunately, emmip() uses
      ggplot2 for its graphs, and we can add elements to it by just adding them
      on as though emmip() was the ggplot() command - but, we need to use the
      names for the variables that emmip() uses internally in order to make this
      work. So, first we will make a data frame with the species, log.weight,
      and log.wing from the hawks data, but we need to call them tvar, xvar, and
      yvar respectively. In the make.ancova.wing.points.df code chunk of your <strong>Rmd
        file</strong>, type:</p>
    <p class="rcmd">wing.points.df &lt;- data.frame(tvar = hawks$Species, xvar =
      hawks$log.weight, yvar = hawks$log.wing)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then, to make the graph, put this command into your <strong>Rmd file</strong>
      (wing.graph.ancova chunk): </p>
    <p class="rcmd">emmip(wing.lm, Species ~ log.weight, cov.reduce = range) +
      geom_point(data = wing.points.df) + geom_vline(xintercept =
      mean(hawks$log.weight))</p>
    <p>The geom_vline() command adds a vertical line that intersects x-axis at
      the mean of log.weight. Where this vertical line crosses the lines for the
      three species are the least-squares means. Your final graph should look
      like this:</p>
    <img src="lsmeans_wing_graph.png" alt="Final wing graph">
    <p>7. Now that you've worked through the analysis for wing chord, repeat the
      analysis for tail length (variable Tail). You will probably need to
      log-transform Tail, like you did Wing - see the Rmd file for prompts for
      the steps you need to take (make sure you change variable names to reflect
      that you're using tail length this time!). </p>
    <h2 class="part" id="allo_iso">Why not use the easy way?</h2>
    <p>After all of of this effort to make mass-adjusted comparisons between
      species using ANCOVA, you may be wondering: why didn't we standardize the
      data by just dividing wing chord or tail length by the weight of the bird?
      This would express the data as a set of wing chords per unit mass that
      would be comparable between the species, so why bother with all these
      ANCOVA, least squares means shenanigans?</p>
    <p>The reason to avoid this method of standardizing for body mass is that it
      doesn't represent the actual scaling relationship well.</p>
    <p>The mean wing chord divided by the mean body mass for each species is the
      slope of a line - with the change in wing chord in the numerator being (<span
        style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>log.wing</sub> - 0), and
      the change in log mass in the denominator being (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>log.mass</sub>
      - 0). If you wanted to predict the mean wing chord of a species from this
      slope you would multiply by the mean log body weight - that is: (mean log
      wing chord/mean log body weight) x mean log body weight = mean log wing
      chord. We got the right answer without having to add an intercept, which
      means that the intercept is zero.</p>
    <p>We could think of standardizing by dividing by log.mass, then, as
      equivalent to fitting linear models with intercepts of 0 and slopes that
      are mean wing chords divided by mean log body weight for each species,
      like so:</p>
    <p>CH: log.wing = 0.91 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>RT: log.wing = 0.85 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>SS: log.wing = 1.06 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>The slope of the lines represent how log wing chord changes as log body
      weight changes, which is the scaling relationship between the variables.
      If we use these models to represent the data, we would be hypothesizing
      that the <em>scaling relationship</em> is different between the species,
      rather than hypothesizing a single, common scaling relationship with
      different <em>intercepts</em>. </p>
    <p>Why would this be a problem?</p>
    <div style="clear:both"> <img alt="Dividing ws by log body" src="ws_body_ratio.png"
        style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">
      <p>The graph on the left shows each of the three equations running through
        the data - as you can see, these models don't fit the data well, because
        the lines don't go through the middle of the data clouds for each
        species the way that regression lines should (and our ANCOVA did), but
        instead they cut through them at an angle.</p>
      <p>If we compared the wing chord per unit body mass we would be comparing
        the slopes of these lines, instead of the vertical distance between
        them. Although the fact that our ANCOVA model fit the data nicely by
        using parallel lines with the same slopes, if we used the ratio of log
        wing chord to log weight instead we would be saying that the scaling
        relationship is different (that is, the rate of change in log wing per
        unit change in log weight is different for the three species). Since
        this model of the data doesn't fit well, and the ANCOVA fits much
        better, we're better off interpreting the differences in least squares
        means from an ANCOVA.</p>
      <p>It is entirely possible that there could be a different scaling
        relationship for the three species, and a set of lines with different
        slopes would be better. We will learn how to model that when we learn
        about statistical interactions in a later activity.</p>
