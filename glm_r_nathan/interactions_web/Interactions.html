      <p class="part" id="intro">Characterizing interactions between variables
        is both one of the most powerful aspects of linear modeling, and one of
        the most easily misunderstood. Today you will conduct an analysis on
        some contrived data from a plant growth experiment, in which growth is
        measure for plants that are given different levels of water (no
        additional water, adequate water) and light (darkness. indirect light,
        direct light), and watering regime (no additional water, adequate
        water). Even without doing any analysis, as a biologist it should be
        obvious that a plant that is given plenty of light and no water will not
        grow well, and that a plant that is given plenty of water but kept in
        the dark will not grow well, but a plant given both adequate light and
        adequate water will grow well. The fact that the response to water
        depends on how much light the plant is exposed to will give us a
        textbook example of a statistical interation.</p>
      <p>The data are made up, but since the patterns are intuitively obvious to
        a biologist, analyzing the data will give you practice interpreting main
        effects and interactions in a two-way factorial ANOVA. The focus of this
        exercise will be on the correct sequence of steps needed to understand a
        particular result, and on the best graphs and numeric summaries for
        understanding interactions when they occur.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="factorials">Analysis of factorial experiments: the
        general approach</h2>
      <p>When you are analyzing data that was collected using a factorial design
        (with two crossed predictors), the set of steps you should follow is as
        follows:<br>
      </p>
      <p>1. Look at the data - make an interaction plot, using one of your
        predictors as x-axis labels, and the other predictor as a grouping
        variable to produce different lines and/or plot symbols for each factor
        level. Use the graph to see if there is any evidence of interaction
        between predictor variables. Apparent effects may not prove to be
        significant, so be careful not to pre-judge the results until you've
        conduced the ANOVA, but this first step helps you anticipate what the
        major patterns are so you can recognize them in the numerical output.<br>
      </p>
      <p>2. Run the model, including the interaction between the predictors, and
        obtain an ANOVA table.<br>
      </p>
      <p>3. If the overall model is significant, check if the interaction term
        is significant, and then:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If the interaction term is not significant, conduct Tukey tests for
            any significant main effects. There is no need to test combinations
            of the two predictors, because the non-significant interaction
            indicates that the differences among levels of one predictor are
            independent of the level of the other predictor, and you can
            interpret them separately.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the interaction term is significant, you will need to take into
            account the level of one predictor when you interpret the other - do
            not try to interpret the main effects directly, they can be
            misleading in the presence of an interaction. You will need to
            compare means for different combinations of predictors against one
            another, but this can be done in different ways. The most common
            approaches are:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Test for differences between the levels of one predictor, within
            each level of the other - for example, you can test for differences
            between the three light levels for plants given adequate light, and
            for plants given no water, but not do any comparisons between plants
            that received different water levels. This approach is a choice to
            leave out some comparisons in order to reduce the amount of
            correction for multiple comparisons needed.</li>
          <li>Test for differences between all possible combinations of the two
            predictors. This approach will allow you to compare means for every
            possible combination of light and water, which is maximally
            informative, but with so many comparisons to do the power of each
            test will be fairly low. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Now that you have the general idea, you can try out this approach with
        some data.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
      <p>The data you will use are in <a href="interaction_examples.xls">this</a>
        file. Start a new project in R Studio, import the data into a data set
        called "plant", and start an R script for your commands. </p>
      <p>If you view the data set, you'll see a column for the dependent
        variable (height), and one each for water and light. Every combination
        of light level and water level is present, with an equal number of
        replicates (3) used for each combination - thus, the experiment is
        complete and balanced, which makes the predictors orthogonal to one
        another. </p>
      <p>1. On your assignment sheet, draw in the results you would expect from
        this experiment in the blank graph in Question 1A. If the lines cross,
        converge, or diverge as you move from the left to the right side of the
        graph that indicates that you should expect an interaction between light
        and water.</p>
      <p>Now, on to the data analysis.</p>
      <p>2. First, look at your data. We will use ggplot2 to make an
        "interaction plot" that uses two different grouping variables and a
        numeric response. The first grouping variable is plotted on the x-axis,
        and the second is used for lines that connect means. </p>
      <p>First, load the library:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p>We will need means and standard errors, so use summarySE to get those,
        and assign them to an object called plant.summ:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plant.summ &lt;- summarySE(plant, measurevar = "height",
        groups = c("water","light"))</p>
      <p>Now you can set up the global settings for your graph with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plant.gg &lt;- ggplot(plant.summ, aes(x = light, y = mean,
        color = water, group = water, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se))</p>
      <p>A couple of new things to notice here...first, we added a setting in
        the aes() statement that identifies water as the groups, as well as the
        colors. We will be adding connecting lines between means for the plot in
        the next step, and geom_lines() requires that groups be identified. We
        are also using a calculation for ymin and ymax that uses the mean and se
        columns in plant.summ, instead of doing the calculations and adding a
        new column to plant.summ first.</p>
      <p>Finally, to get the graph we need to add points, error bars, and line
        geometric objects to our plant.gg object:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plant.gg + geom_point() + geom_errorbar(width = 0.1) +
        geom_line()</p>
      <p>Using a width statement in geom_errorbar() makes the top of the
        crossbar narrower and more attractive.</p>
      <p>Based on the graph you should have some idea of what is going to happen
        when you fit the model - the lines are clearly not parallel, so we have
        reason to expect an interaction (provided we have enough statistical
        power to detect it).<br>
      </p>
      <p>3. Test the model. The complete model specification would be: </p>
      <p>height ~ light + water + light*water</p>
      <p>But, linear models are hierarchical, meaning that you can't include an
        interaction term without also including main effects for both of the
        factors. As a shorthand for this full specification, then, R allows us
        to use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(height ~ light*water, data = plant)</p>
      <p>4. Generate an ANOVA table, and see whether there is a significant
        interaction between light and water. This model is balanced and
        complete, meaning that there are equal numbers of data points in each
        combination of light and water, and every combination is included in the
        data set. Because of this, light and water are orthogonal, and it won't
        matter if you use Type I or Type II sums of squares, so you can get an
        ANOVA table using either anova() or Anova().</p>
      <p>You can plot the interaction using the effects package - load it with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(effects)</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">plot(effect("light*water", plant.lm),
          multiline=TRUE)</span></p>
      <p>This is essentially the same plot as you made earlier, but effect()
        uses the least squares means estimated from the model, which can be
        different with unbalanced designs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>5. Now what? </p>
      <p>We definitely have an interaction, which means that we can't apply a
        naive interpretation of the main effects - for example, if we just did
        Tukey post-hocs on light level, we would get a significant increase in
        height for indirect light compared to the other two light levels, but
        this would entirely be due to the high mean when adequate water is
        provided - if you don't water the plants you don't get this positive
        effect of indirect light. Given that we are going to have to explain
        this contingent relationship between water and light, the main effects
        don't really add anything to our understanding of the biology of the
        system. To understand what's going on, we need to compare pairs of means
        for combinations of light and water.</p>
      <p>But, which comparisons to make depends on what we really want to know.
        Let's look at some possible approaches, depending on the question we're
        interested in answering:</p>
      <p>Question 1: what is the best combination of light and water?</p>
      <p>We can look at the graph and see that adequate water and indirect light
        certainly seems to be the best, but we don't know if that combination is
        significantly different from the others. We should test all of the means
        against one another, and if indirect light, adequate water is
        significantly different from all the other combinations we can conclude
        it's the best.</p>
      <p>The simplest method of comparing all the combinations of factor levels
        to one another in R is to combine the water and light factors into a
        single factor with six groups (one each for the possible combinations of
        light and water), and then run a one-way ANOVA with this new merged
        factor. We can then conduct Tukey post-hocs to see which of the combined
        levels are different. The interaction() function combines variables for
        us, so use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plant$light.water &lt;- with(plant, interaction(light,
        water))</p>
      <p>After you're done view the plant data set to see what
        interaction(light, water) does - there will be a new column called
        light.water that contains combinations of light and water separated by a
        period. </p>
      <p>You can now use light.water as the predictor in a one-way ANOVA,
        complete with Tukey post-hocs - you know how to do this, please do so.</p>
      <p>This approach is the most information rich, because every pair of means
        is tested. The problem is that there are six different means, and it
        takes 15 different comparisons (with 15 p-values) to test all of them.
        This is an issue because the p-value is adjusted for the number of
        comparisons, and comparing all of the means against one another reduces
        the power of each comparison. If you really want to compare all of the
        combinations, this is just the cost of doing business.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you are only actually interested in comparing
        some of the pairs anyway, then testing only a subset of the possible
        pairs of means is a good idea - you will get increased power for the
        comparisons that you do. So, for example, if your question is:</p>
      <p>Question 2: at each level of water, which light levels are different?</p>
      <p>then you can reduce the number of comparisons that you make by more
        than half. If we only make comparisons between the three light levels
        that have adequate water, and the three light levels that have no water,
        we only have to test a total of six differences. Using this approach
        sacrifices comparisons between water levels, so we can't talk about the
        differences between water levels when we present our results, but if we
        already know that watering plants is important and are only interested
        in how water level and light level interact, then this may be a good
        choice.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this is one of the cases in which R makes the relatively
        simple very difficult - difficult enough, in fact, that we might be
        tempted to do the wrong analysis because it's easier to accomplish than
        doing the right analysis. The relatively easy, but wrong, approach is to
        subset the data into just adequate water and just no water data sets,
        and run a separate one-way ANOVA on each data set. I'll show you the
        effect of making the wrong choice as a demonstration (gray box) - read
        through it and make sure you understand the problem before you move on
        to the correct way.</p>

        <h3>The easy (but wrong) way to analyze differences in light level at a
          given water level</h3>
        <p>If we do the analysis by splitting the data, we would be working with

        <p>Seems reasonable, but it's wrong for a couple of reasons. The first
          reason is that the standard error used in the Tukey tests are
          different for the two water levels. We're assuming equal variances
          between the groups, and if this is true we get the best estimate of
          the amount of random variation in the data when all of the data is
          included (better estimates from larger sample sizes, don't you know).
          If you look at the two ANOVA tables for the split data, above, and
          compare it to the table for the entire data set here:</p>
        <p><span class="R-code rout">Response: height<br>

            Residuals&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp; 83.53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.96</span></p>
        <p>the residual MS is different for all three, but we expect it to be
          most accurate for the last table with all the data included.</p>
        <p>The other problem is that splitting the data set into two parts
          causes the Tukey tests to only adjust for the three comparisons within
          each water level. The reason for doing Tukey tests instead of t-tests
          on pairs of means is that Tukey adjusts for the number of tests we do,
          to avoid increasing Type I error rates. We end up doing a total of 6
          post-hoc comparisons, so the number we <em>should</em> be adjusting
          for is 6 - splitting the data fails to control the Type I error rate
          properly.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, we need to do this correctly.</p>
      <p>The way to get glht() to give us the comparisons we need is to set up
        "contrast matrices" that specify which means are to be compared with one
        another. The contrast matrices only make sense in the context of using
        matrix algebra for the comparisons, which is a little beyond what I
        expect you to know from your math classes. If you are interested, you
        can check out <a href="Contrast%20matrices.html">this link</a>, which
        will walk you through what a contrast matrix does, and how to set one
        up. And, if you're really interested, read <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multcomp/vignettes/multcomp-examples.pdf">this
          paper</a> explaining how to set up your own custom tests using glht
        (written by the author of the multcomp package).</p>
      <p>I've written a script that does the work of setting up the contrast
        matrices for you - download <a href="test_conditional.R">this file</a>
        (right-click and "save target as"). Open it in R Commander and source it
        to get test.conditional() added to your workspace.</p>
      <p>test.conditional() has three arguments: the name of a fitted model
        object (with a significant interaction), the name of a variable you want
        to use to subset the data (the "conditional" variable), and the name of
        a variable whose levels you want to compare with Tukey tests. The
        function takes these three pieces of information, constructs the needed
        contrast matrix, and submits it as input to the glht() function. The
        output you get is the same as if you had used glht() directly, so if you
        nest the test.conditional() command within a summary() command you will
        get tests and p-values. </p>
      <p>To use the function, you can write the command:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">summary(test.conditional(plant.lm, "water",
          "light"))</span></p>
      <p>You'll see in the output window that you get lines that look like this:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneous Tests

      <p>The labeling gives the factor level for water first, followed by a
        colon, followed by the names of the two light levels that are being
        tested. The first three lines compare the means for all possible
        combinations of light level, given adequate water, and the last three
        give the comparisons given no water. Note that all six comparisons are
        done here, so the tests are (correctly) adjusting for all six
        comparisons, and all are using the same standard error taken from the
        complete ANOVA table.</p>
      <p>The command is smart enough to work with either variable set as the
        conditional variable - try it using light as the conditional and water
        as the test variable and see what happens.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="interactions_collin">Interactions vs. correlated
        predictors</h2>
      <p>There's a question on your worksheet about the difference between
        interactions and correlated predictors - before you try to answer it
        read through this explanation of the issue. It's easier to see the point
        if we have an equal number of levels in the light and water data set, so
        the graphs show three levels of water - I added a "moderate" level,
        which is just halfway between the adequate and none water levels at each
        light level.</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Interaction plot" src="interaction_plot.png"><br>
            </td>
            <td><img alt="3D plot, interaction" src="interaction_3d.png"><br>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>We set up the design to have all possible combinations of light
                level and water level, with equal numbers of replicates in each
                combination (each "cell", to use experimental design
                terminology). The graphs to the left show the patterns of
                response in both a (now familiar) interaction plot, and as a
                three-dimensional bar chart.</p>
              <p>The interaction plot shows the lack of parallel in responses
                (i.e. heights) for the combinations of the predictors, but the
                3D plot shows the design of the experiment better - you can see
                that all the combinations of light and water were used, and that
                the response to one predictor (e.g. light) depends on the other
                (e.g. water).</p>

            </td>
            <td>
              <p>What if we had used a design that only had the combinations
                direct.adequate, indirect.moderate, and none.none? You can see
                on the 3D plot that this introduces a correlation between the
                predictors that is so severe that the predictors are completely
                confounded - if you know the water level, you also know the
                light level. You can no longer tell when a response is due to
                the water level, the light level, or a combination of the two.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>So, correlated predictors are a problem that makes it difficult to tell
        how each predictor affects the response variable. Interactions measure
        the extent to which response to one variable depends on another, and we
        can't even assess whether interactions exist unless we have enough
        independent variation between the predictors to measure their joint
        effects.</p>

        output to the course web site.</p>
