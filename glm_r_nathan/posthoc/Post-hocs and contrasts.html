      <h2 class="part" id="tukey">Tukey post-hocs</h2>
      <p>You learned to do Tukey post-hocs in Biol 215, so we won't spend too
        much time on the simple application to a one-way ANOVA. But, R doesn't
        make post-hocs as easy to do as MINITAB, so we need to learn how to get
        post-hocs from R. We will also learn more about planned comparisons,
        including orthogonal polynomial contrasts as a special case.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>For the assignment, make sure you copy all of your output (including
        any graphs you produce) into a Word file for upload.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>1. First, start R Studio and make a new project in a folder called
        "posthocs". Import the allsp worksheet from the cuckoo data we used last
        week, into an R data set called "allsp".</p>
      <p>Start a new R script to use for all the commands you use today.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. Now, we we are going to reorder the factor levels for species to
        reflect the sizes of the birds. Based on their body weights, the species
        (listed smallest to largest) are: wren, meadow pipit, robin, hedge
        sparrow, tree pipit, and pied wagtail. To set the factor levels to this
        order, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">allsp$species &lt;- factor(allsp$species, levels =
        c("Wren","Meadow Pipit","Robin","Hedge Sparrow","Tree Pipit", "Pied
        Wagtail"))</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With the species in order by body size, you can now load gplots and
        make a graph with plotmeans() that shows weights for the species, and
        the x-axis will put the species in the order you specified.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now fit a linear model of length as a function of species, and call it
        allsp.bw.lm (where the "bw" is short for "body weight").</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. There is a TukeyHSD() command in R, but it's not flexible enough to
        do everything we want for the rest of the semester, so we are going to
        start learning an add-on package that we will need later. You can load
        add-on packages (which R calls "libraries") with a command:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">library(multcomp)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      There are many kinds of post-hoc procedures, but we will primarily focus
      on Tukey's, which works well for unplanned comparisons among all possible
      pairs of means. The multcomp package uses a single command, glht(), for
      all of its post-hocs, with arguments that indicate the kind of post-hoc to
      return.<br>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To get Tukey post-hocs, type the command:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">allsp.bw.tukey &lt;- glht(allsp.bw.lm, linfct =
          mcp(species = "Tukey"))</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This is a fairly complex command, so let's unpack it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The work is being done by the glht() function. The name, glht, stands
        for "general linear hypothesis test". This function can do lots of
        different things, and can take several different arguments that we don't
        need to worry about. This is common in R functions - there will be
        arguments that are required such that omitting them will cause an error,
        but others are optional, and if they aren't specified then default
        values are used.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The first required argument for glht() is the name of the model we will
        be working with - we used allsp.bw.lm.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The next argument is "linfct", which stands for "linear function". This
        is where we specify what kind of comparisons we will use. We are
        specifying this argument using a function called mcp(), which stands for
        "multiple comparison procedure". You can see that we are setting up
        Tukey multiple comparisons between the levels of the species variable,
        using mcp(species = "Tukey").</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To get the Tukey comparisons, now issue the command:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">summary(allsp.bw.tukey)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You will see all fifteen of the comparisons that can be made between
        the six species, along with their p-values, reported. When you use
        post-hoc procedures like the Tukey test the correction for multiple
        comparisons is done for you, and you can consider any p-values below
        0.05 to be significant.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. A list of 15 comparisons is difficult to interpret. A simpler
        presentation is the "compact letter display", which we can get with the
        command:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">cld(allsp.bw.tukey)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This will give you output that looks like this:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Wren&nbsp; Meadow
          Pipit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robin Hedge
          Sparrow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tree Pipit &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "a"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "b"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "bc"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "c"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          "c"&nbsp; <br>
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="rout">Pied Wagtail &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "bc"&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The compact letter display examines all the p-values generated by the
        Tukey procedure, and assigns the same letters to species that are not
        significantly different, and different letters to species that are
        significantly different. Based on this output, you should see that wrens
        are different from everyone, because only wrens are assigned the letter
        "a". There are a couple more significant differences, can you see what
        they are? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('whodiff')">Click here to
          see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div style="display:none;" id="whodiff">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Meadow pipit only has an b,
          and tree pipit and hedge sparrows only have a c, so meadow pipit is
          different from those two species (but they are not different from each
          other). Pied wagtail and robin have both an b and a c, so they are not
          different from either meadow pipit, tree pipit, or hedge sparrow. </p>
      </div>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="orthog_poly">Orthogonal polynomial contrasts</h2>
      <p>When we put the species in body weight order that was enough to get our
        plot of means in the order we wanted, and it's enough to get R to use
        Wren as the baseline group when it fits the linear model (remember, this
        means that the tests of the slope coefficients were tests of differences
        between the other species and Wren).</p>
      <p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but we didn't make an "ordered factor"
        when we put the factor levels in body weight order. Analytically,
        nothing was done differently except that wrens were set to be the
        baseline group. An ordered factor is a kind of factor in which the order
        of the factor levels are not just arbitrary, but instead reflect an
        ordinal relationship. We are going to do the factor level re-ordering
        again, but this time we are going to make an actual ordered factor. The
        advantage of doing this is that by default R uses orthogonal polynomial
        contrasts when you use an ordered factor in a linear model. We will be
        able to test for various shapes of response across the ordinal factor
        levels by seeing which of the orthogonal polynomial coefficients is
        significant.</p>
      <p>1. To make an ordered factor, you can make a copy of the factor()
        command you used above, but add the "ordered = T" argument, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">allsp$species &lt;- factor(allsp$species, levels =
        c("Wren","Meadow Pipit","Robin","Hedge Sparrow","Tree Pipit", "Pied
        Wagtail"), ordered = T) </p>
      <p>If you type allsp$species at the command prompt you'll see at the
        bottom that the factor levels are separated by less than symbols, &lt;,
        indicating the ordinal relationship between them.</p>
      <p>2. We are going to fit a linear model again, and now that species is
        ordered we will get orthogonal polynomial contrasts instead of dummy
        coding. Let's take a look at what the orthogonal polynomial contrasts
        actually do - enter the command:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code">contr.poly(6)</span></p>
      <p>This dumps a bunch of weights to the screen so you can look at them,
        but hasn't changed any settings. If you look down each column, you'll
        see the weights follow the pattern you would expect - the .L column
        gives weights for a linear trend, and the start at -0.597, and increase
        in equal intervals to 0.597. The quadratic term (.Q) starts high,
        descends to a minimum, and then returns to the same high point (that is,
        it's concave upwards). And so forth. These weights establish the basic
        patterning that each contrast will be testing for in the data.</p>
      <blockquote style="background: #f5f5fb; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px;">
        <p>A little aside on R...</p>
        <p>You can see what the default contrast types are by using the command:</p>
        <p><span class="rcmd">options("contrasts")</span></p>
        <p>This should show you that the default contrasts are "contr.Treatment"
          "contr.poly", which are the contrasts used for un-ordered factors and
          for ordered factors, respectively. The "treatment" contrast type is
          another name for dummy-coding.</p>
        <p>So, we get polynomial contrasts because we are going to use an
          ordered factor, but what if we wanted to get dummy-coded contrasts
          back, so that we could compare all the species to wrens again? There
          are two choices: change the default, or assign treatment contrasts to
          species (which overrides the default polynomial contrasts).</p>
        <p>To change the default value, we would use the command:</p>
        <p><span class="rcmd">options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment",
            "contr.treatment"))</span></p>
        <p>This would set the contrast type to dummy-coded contrasts for both
          unordered and ordered factors. Changing the default changes what R
          will use for any ordered factor we choose, within this project. We
          could then set it back to default with:</p>
        <p><span class="rcmd">options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment",
            "contr.poly"))</span></p>
        <p>If we wanted to just override the orthogonal polynomials for species,
          without affecting any other ordered factor we might use later, we
          could set the contrasts for the species variable:</p>
        <p><span class="R-code rcmd"> contrasts(allsp.bw$species) &lt;-
            contr.treatment(6) </span></p>
        <p>where the argument 6 in contr.treatment() says to dummy code for 6
          different levels. To set the contrasts back to orthogonal polynomial
          for species, you would use the command: </p>
        <p><span class="R-code rcmd">contrasts(allsp.bw$species) &lt;-
            contr.poly(6) </span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, let's see what happens when we run the model with an ordered
        factor for species:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">allsp.op.lm &lt;- lm(length ~ species,
          data=allsp.bw)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This command fits exactly the same linear model as we used before, with
        length predicted by species, but this time species is ordered. The
        fitted model is assigned to allsp.op.lm. To see the coefficients, type
        the name of the fitted model object:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">summary(allsp.op.lm)</span></p>
      <p>The model output looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call: <br>
        lm(formula = length ~ species, data = allsp) <br>

      <p>If you compare the model output here to what you got with the unordered
        version of species, the bottom section is identical - using an ordered
        factor doesn't change the model fit. But, the coefficient tests are
        tests of trend across the ordered species levels. You'll see that the
        linear (.L) and quadratic (.Q) terms are significant, but the rest are
        not.</p>
      <p>When you interpret orthogonal polynomials, remember that they add
        together. The first, linear trend has a positive coefficient, which
        tells us that there is also a tendency for the means to increase from
        left to right on the graph. The second, quadratic trend has a negative
        coefficient. Remember from the matrix of contrast weights that they
        represented a parabola that is concave upwards, but the trend in the egg
        length data reaches a peak and levels off or declines a little - the
        negative coefficient flips the parabola so that it's concave downward.
        Adding this trend to the linear one means that there is a tendency for
        the means to increase to a peak and then decline as you go from left to
        right on the graph. This matches our impression from looking at the
        graph nicely, and provides us with some statistical support for claiming
        that cuckoos adjust their egg sizes to the host species size, up to a
        maximum egg size that the cuckoos are able to produce.</p>
      <p>3. Feeling adventurous? If you're in the mood for a challenge, continue
        (yes, this step is optional, but if you want to start fleshing out your
        R skills you should opt to do it).</p>
      <p>R is pretty powerful, it isn't just a tool for running canned
        procedures. We know that in order to perfectly reproduce the means for
        each species we need to use all of the contrasts, up to the 5th degree,
        but only the linear and quadratic trends were statistically significant.
        If we would like to see what the linear and quadratic trends actually
        look like, we can use R to predict the means using those two sets of
        contrast weights and coefficients.</p>
      <p>We want to add points to your plot of means that indicate the predicted
        values for the trends we've identified as significant. To do this, we
        need to extract the coefficients from our fitted model, and the weights
        from our factor. First the coefficients:</p>
      <p><span class="rcmd">coef(allsp.op.lm) -&gt; species.coef</span></p>
      <p>This uses the coef() function to extract the coefficients, and then
        assigns them to the species.coef object. Nothing will be displayed on
        the screen, but to see what's in species.coef, just type the name of the
        object and hit Enter.</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">species.coef</span></p>
      <p>Now we need the contrast weights. We will use the same contrasts()
        function we used before, but this time instead of assigning contrasts
        with it, we will be extracting the weights from species instead.</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">contrasts(allsp$species) -&gt;
          species.contrasts</span></p>
      <p>Again, if you want to see what this did, enter the name of the
        species.contrasts object we created:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">species.contrasts</span></p>
      <p>You should see a matrix with the weights for each trend, and with rows
        labeled by species names (if we had just used contr.poly(6) -&gt;
        species.contrasts we would have gotten the same set of weights, but
        using the species column gets R to count up the number of levels and
        construct the contrasts accordingly).</p>
      <p>Now we are going to use the coefficients and weights to calculate the
        linear trend.</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">species.coef[1] +
          species.coef[2]*species.contrasts[ ,1] -&gt; linear ; linear</span></p>
      <p>This command will show you the result of our calculation, because I
        added a "; linear" to the end of the command. The semicolon allows a
        second command to be added to the line, and since the command just named
        the object called "linear" we created with our calculation, it displays
        the predicted linear trend values on the screen.</p>
      <p>The actual calculation takes the intercept from species.coef (which we
        indicated by giving its "index" number within the brackets - it's the
        first coefficient in species.coef, so species.coef[1] is the intercept),
        then adds to it the product of the slope (species.coef[2]) multiplied by
        the weights for the linear trend (species.contrasts[ ,1]). The indexing
        is different for species.contrasts because it is a matrix, so it has
        both rows and columns. The numbers in the brackets indicate the row
        number and the column number as [row number, column number]. We wanted
        all of the rows for column 1, which we got by leaving the row index
        blank, and by using a 1 for the column index. Note that what this
        equation did was to take the single values for the intercept and slope
        and then apply them to each row in the linear trend column.</p>
      <p>Now, to add the linear trend to the graph, you need to use the command:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">points(linear, pch=21, bg="green")</span></p>
      <p>This command adds points to the currently active plot - we used
        "linear" as the argument, since that's the object that has the linear
        trend numbers. The other two arguments control the appearance of the
        points - pch is "point character", and number 21 is a filled circle; bg
        is "background color", and we set the fill color to "green".</p>
      <p>Next, let's calculate the quadratic trend. We already have the linear
        trend, and as you learned in lecture these terms are meant to be
        interpreted hierarchically - the quadratic trend is added to the linear
        trend, it's not interpreted on its own. So, we just need to calculate
        the quadratic part, and add it to our linear trend values.</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">species.coef[3]*species.contrasts[,2] +
          linear -&gt; quadratic ; quadratic</span></p>
      <p>Like before, the coefficient for the quadratic term (species.coef[3])
        is multiplied by each row in the second column of weights matrix
        (species.contrasts[,2]), and this time the product is added to an
        existing set of linear values; this is all then assigned to a new object
        called "quadratic".</p>
      <p>Try adding the points for the quadratic trend to your plot. Use "red"
        for the bacground color this time. You should see that with this
        quadratic term included the red dots are very close to the observed
        means, including between Tree Pipit and Pied Wagtail where the size dips
        a little.</p>
      <p>We could keep adding on the cubic, 4th, and 5th order terms, but none
        of those were statistically significant. If we did include all of them,
        though, the predicted means would be equal to the measured group means,
        instead of being only approximately close to them.</p>
