      <p class="part" id="intro">Multiple regression is an extension of simple
        linear regression that uses more than one predictor to model a single
        response variable. As you learned in the lecture preceding this
        exercise, using two predictors fits a plane through the dependent
        variable, and each new predictor adds another dimension to the surface
        (beyond two predictors it becomes difficult to visualize the surface,
        but the process is fundamentally the same above three dimensions). The
        equation for a multiple regression is a simple extension of the linear
        regression equation, in which a new product of a slope coefficient and
        variable is added for each additional predictor:</p>

          hspace="8" height="20" align="middle" border="0"></p>
      <p>The statistical output associated with a multiple regression is also
        similar to simple linear regression output, but with some exceptions
        that we'll explore today. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We will use data from <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2012$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=283;dataMax=110808$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=18;dataMax=87$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=;example=75">gapminder.org</a>
        to explore how multiple regression can be used to either enhance
        significant relationships (i.e. statistically eliminating statistical
        noise caused by a nuisance variable), or to avoid spurious effects of a
        confounding variable. We will also explore how correlations between
        predictor variables can affect interpretation of our results.</p>
      <p>Start a new project for today's exercise in R Studio (call the folder
        "multreg"), and start a new R script for your commands. The data set we
        will use today is <a href="gapminder.xlsx">here</a>. Download and
        import the file into R Studio - call the data set "gapminder".</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Before we go on, a couple of points about multiple regression data.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Data organization: Data should be in a "multivariate" arrangement.
          Each row is an individual observation (a different country, in this
          case), and each column will be a variable measured on the observation,
          either the response variable or one of the predictors.</p>
        <p> Missing data: Any missing numbers for any of the variables cause the
          entire row to be dropped from the analysis. For example, Afghanistan
          was not included in this data set because per-capita gross domestic
          product and HIV infection rate were missing. You will see that using
          multiple predictors can have some tremendous benefits, but one cost is
          that it is very important that every measurement is collected for
          every variable. Having to drop some of your hard work because you
          forgot to record one variable is heartbreaking, don't let this happen
          to you.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The first column in the data set is Country. Rather than being a
        variable for analysis, this is meant to be a label for the row, which
        will be used to label graphs in later steps. To set the row labels, use
        the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">rownames(gapminder) &lt;- gapminder$Country</p>
      <p>The variables included in the data set are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life expectancy - this is the average lifespan expected at birth.
          Infant mortality is included in this measure. Life expectancy will be
          the response variable for all of our analyses.</li>
        <li>Log of Population density - log of the number of people per unit
          area. This is at measured at the level of the entire country -
          population size divided by the area of the country.</li>
        <li>Log of Per Capita GDP - gross domestic product divided by population
          size, then log transformed.</li>
        <li>Cholesterol - total cholesterol in blood of men in mmol/L.
          Standardized for differences in age distribution.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Tuberculosis rate - all forms of TB, existing cases per 100,000
          people in the population.</li>
        <li>Maternal mortality - maternal deaths per live birth, multiplied by
          100,000 (so, maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births).</li>
        <li>Babies per woman - children per woman in the population, including
          women who do not have children.</li>
        <li>Crude birth rate - births per 1000 people in the population, men and
          women, with children and without.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Log transformation means that the numbers are (natural) logs of each
        measurement. To use regression we need the relationship between life
        expectancy and each of the predictors to be linear, and log
        transformation can change a curvilinear relationship into a linear one.
        We'll learn more about transformations when we talk about assumptions of
        GLM later this semester, but for now just bear in mind that the units
        are on a natural log scale for these variables - the minimum logGDP of
        4.539 is e<sup>4.539</sup> = $93.60 per person, and the maximum of
        10.940 is e<sup>10.940</sup> = $56,387 dollars per person. </p>
      <p>To get an idea of the patterns in the data set, produce a scatterplot
        matrix of all of the variables with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">pairs(gapminder[,-1])</p>
      <p>This will give you a matrix of scatter plots with the names of the
        variables on the main diagonal. If you click the "Zoom" button above the
        plot it will pop out into its own window, which you can resize to full
        screen so you can see better.</p>
      <p>The names label the x-axis if you project up or down, and label the
        y-axis if you project left or right. This means that every pair of
        variables is plotted twice, but with the x-variable and y-variable
        switched.</p>
      <p>Copy and paste this graph into a Word file, and make a mental note of
        which ones seem to have strong relationships with life expectancy (the
        dependent variable we will use today), and which <em> predictors</em>
        seem to be highly correlated with one another.</p>
      <p>Okay, time to run some regressions. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="case1">Case 1: Multiple regression may enhance the
        significance of relationships between variables.</h2>
      <p> I won't be telling you what to name your models as you work through
        the instructions, but do get into the habit of using a sensible naming
        convention so you can keep track of what they are. For example,
        LinearModel.1 is a poor choice compared with life.pop.gdp.lm - the
        latter indicates which variables are included, and that the object is a
        fitted linear model rather than a data set. </p>
      <p>1. Do a linear model of Life.expectancy (response) on logPop.Density
        (predictor). Record the regression coefficient and p-value on your
        worksheet. With just one predictor, this is a simple linear regression.</p>
      <p>Also record the statistics for the "omnibus" test of the model - this
        is reported below the coefficients, starting with "Residual standard
        error:". We are primarily interested in the explained variation (the
        Multiple R-squared), and the hypothesis test, which is based on the
        F-statistic, numerator and denominator degrees of freedom, and p-value.</p>
      <p>You'll see there is a positive relationship between life expectancy and
        population density. However, we might expect other factors to affect
        life expectancy, in addition to the density of the population. Wealth is
        expected to affect life expectancy as well, because wealthier countries
        are able to afford better health care, better sanitation, and better
        nutrition, all of which should have positive effects on life expectancy.
        So, two countries with identical population densities are likely to have
        different life expectancies if one is wealthier than the other, and this
        variation due to wealth will add scatter around the line if we only use
        population density as a predictor. We can see what happens to the slope
        and the p-value for logPop.Density when we add logGDP as a predictor.</p>
      <p>2. Do a linear model of Life.expectancy on logPop.Density and logGDP.
        Since this analysis uses more than one predictor it is a "multiple
        regression", and all you need to do is to include both logPop.Density
        and logGDP in the model with a + in between them, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(Life.expectancy ~ logPop.Density + logGDP, data =
        gapminder)</p>
      <p>Assign this model to an object, and use summary() to obtain
        coefficients and the results of the omnibus test for your worksheet.</p>
      <p>You should see that including logGDP made the p-value for
        logPop.Density smaller, but also made the slope smaller. Slopes in
        multiple regression are partial relationships, meaning they are based on
        the collective effects of the predictors on the response. All else being
        equal, a bigger slope will generate a smaller p-value than a smaller
        slope, but in this case the reduction in the size of the slope due to
        including logGDP was more than made up for by the reduction in residual
        sums of squares. You can see the R<sup>2</sup> went way up when logGDP
        was added, which means that we explained a lot more variation in life
        expectancy when we included it - when logGDP was not included, all of
        that variation due to logGDP was treated as random, unexplained
        variation, and was left in the residual SS. Since we're comparing
        explained variation to unexplained variation in our ANOVA table, if we
        leave some variation in the residual term that could have been explained
        by another predictor the p-value for the test of the variables included
        will be bigger. Thus, leaving logGDP out made the p-value on the test of
        logPop.Density go up. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. To visualize what is happening, we will make a 3-D graph of
        Life.expectancy, logPop.Density, and logGDP. The function we need is in
        the library "car" (short for "companion to applied regression"), which
        you can load now with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(car)</p>
      <p>The command for the 3D plot is called scatter3d(), and it has several
        arguments. For longer commands like this one you can break the command
        with carriage returns, and then select all of the lines before hitting
        the "Run" button:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">scatter3d(Life.expectancy~logPop.Density+logGDP,
        data=gapminder, <br>
        fit="linear",&nbsp;
        <br>
        residuals=TRUE, <br>
        bg="white", <br>
        axis.scales=TRUE, <br>
        grid=TRUE, <br>
        ellipsoid=FALSE)</p>
      <p>The graph may pop up behind the R Studio window, move it if you don't
        see the graph. </p>
      <p>When the graph first appears, it will be oriented so that the plane
        you're fitting through the data is viewed from the side - it looks like
        a line through the scatter of data. Positive residuals are shown in
        green, and negative residuals are shown in red. You'll see that the two
        predictors form the bottom axes on the graph.<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Grab the plot with your mouse and rotate it so that logPop.Density is
        horizontal, Life.expectancy is vertical, and logGDP is pointed directly
        into the screen - this will show you what the relationship looks like
        between life expectancy and population density if GDP isn't accounted
        for. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You should be able to see two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the relationship is really messy if you only look at logPop.Density
          as a predictor, and</li>
        <li>the plane through the data is slanted away from you, into the
          screen, showing that some of the variability along the y-axis is
          because of variation in GDP.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Now, grab the graph with the mouse again, and arrange it so that logGDP
        is horizontal, life expectancy is vertical, and population density is
        into the monitor. This orientation looks better - closer to a line
        through a data scatter. This is because logGDP has a bigger effect on
        life expectancy than does logPop.Density, and this tilts the plane more
        strongly along the logGDP axis.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>4. You can identify points on the graph with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(gapminder, Identify3d(logPop.Density, logGDP,
        Life.expectancy, axis.scales=TRUE, labels=row.names(gapminder)))</p>
      <p>You can now find points that have the longest positive and negative
        residuals, and use the <em><strong>right</strong></em> mouse button to
        drag a box around the points (don't just click, or you'll have to start
        over). The case names will then be displayed on the graph. Find which
        countries have the longest life expectancies for their GDP, and which
        have the shortest, based on the sizes of their residuals.</p>
      <p>If you're using a Mac, I believe you need to hold down the CTRL button
        while you drag a box to emulate a right mouse button.</p>
      <p>When you're done, right-click on the 3-D graph once to turn off the
        identify3D() function.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>5. It would be nice to more quantitatively assess which predictor had
        more effect on life expectancy, but we can't compare the slopes
        directly. Slopes are related to the strength of the relationship between
        predictor and response, but slopes also have units (specifically, y
        units divided by x units). Regression coefficients can be different just
        because the units of measure for the predictors are different. </p>
      <p>This can be addressed by using "standardized coefficients", which
        converts the units on the slopes to standard deviations. R doesn't
        report these by default, but I have written a function that will
        calculate standardized coefficients for you. You can add this new
        function into R by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right click on <a title="Standardized coefficients script" href="stdcoeff.R">this
            link</a> and select "Save link as...". Save the file in your project
          folder.</li>
        <li>Select File → Open, and find the file you just downloaded - it's
          called stdcoeff.R</li>
        <li>Click "Source" to read the entire script file into R - this will
          create a new command called stdcoeff()<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, below the script you just submitted, type the command:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">stdcoeff(<em class="R-code">your.fitted.model.name</em>)</span></p>
      <p>be sure to replace "your.fitted.model.name" with the actual name of the
        fitted model you used, and then click Submit. You will see the
        standardized coefficients in the Output Window, they should be 0.15 for
        logPop.Density, and 0.79 for logGDP.</p>
      <p>The standardized coefficients tell you that for each standard deviation
        of increase in logPopDensity you gain 0.15 standard deviations of life
        expectancy, but for each standard deviation of increase in logGDP you
        gain 0.79 standard deviations of life expectancy - logGDP has over five
        times as much effect on life expectancy as logPopDensity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="case2">Case 2: Multiple regression reducing the
        strength of relationships between variables.</h2>
      <p>1. Do a linear model of Life.expectancy (response) against Cholesterol
        (predictor). Record the coefficient and p-value on your assignment
        sheet.</p>
      <p>2. This unexpected positive relationship at the country level is
        suspicious - it's unlikely that more cholesterol is good for your
        longevity, and the relationship could easily be due to correlations
        between both cholesterol and life expectancy with wealth and the quality
        health care that tends to go along with it. If cholesterol really is
        good for you, it should be detectable as an effect that is above and
        beyond the effects of wealth and the general quality of health care in
        the country.</p>
      <p>To check this, do a (multiple) regression of Life.expectancy against
        Cholesterol, logGDP (as an indicator of wealth), Maternal.mortality, and
        TB (as indicators of effectiveness of health care and public health
        systems). Record the coefficients on your worksheet.</p>
      <p>3. Now we'll see how the types of sums of squares we use affects our
        interpretation of the results.</p>
      <p>The anova() command we have been using so far gives sequential ("Type
        I") sums of squares, so use it now to get an ANOVA table with Type I
        sums of squares.</p>
      <p>The car library we loaded earlier has an Anova() command (note the
        capital A) that allows us to select either Type II or Type III, with
        Type II as default. Use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">Anova(<em>your.fitted.model.name</em>)</p>
      <p>to get your Type II table.</p>
      <p>As you answer the question about why Cholesterol was only significant
        when you ran the analysis with Type I SS, think in terms of shared
        variation with other predictors - how is the correlated part of the
        predictors treated when you use Type I SS? How is it treated when you
        use Type II SS?</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="case3">Case 3: Correlated predictors cause problems
        in interpretation.<br>
      </h2>
      <p>Two of the variables in the data set are highly correlated with one
        another: babies per woman, and birth rate. Babies per woman is
        calculated as number of babies born, divided by number of women in the
        country. Birth rate also uses the number of babies born, but it is
        divided by the number of people in the country. If every country had the
        same sex ratio the numbers would be perfectly correlated, and only
        variations in sex ratio weaken the correlation between them; since sex
        ratios are not that variable, these two variables are just slightly
        different measures of the same thing.</p>
      <p>First, let's confirm that each variable by itself is a significant
        predictor of life expectancy.</p>
      <p>1. Do a linear model of Life.expectancy on Birth.rate. Report the
        coefficients and p-value.</p>
      <p>2. Do a linear model of Life.expectancy on Babies.per.woman.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Given that both are good predictors, it seems as though including both
        in the same model would be better still.<br>
      </p>
      <p>3. Now, do (multiple) regression of Life.expectancy on both Birth.rate
        and Babies.per.woman. Report the coefficients and p-values.</p>
      <p>When you include both of the predictors at the same time, you'll see
        that one of the predictors is still highly significant, and the other is
        no longer significant at all. It's obvious enough that this is the case,
        but it's not so obvious how it could be true. Certainly it's due to the
        fact that birth rate and babies per woman are correlated - if they were
        independent then we would get the same slope coefficients whether we
        included both of them or just one at a time. The correlation between
        birth rate and babies per woman is very high, r = 0.983, but this
        correlation applies equally to both of them. How, then, is it possible
        for this high correlation to result in babies per woman being a poor
        predictor of life expectancy when it is included with birth rate, but
        for birth rate to still be a significant predictor?</p>

              <p> We can see what is happening using a Venn diagram. The blue

                babies per woman. Ignoring life expectancy for the moment, you
                can see that the amount of overlap between the two predictors is
                high to reflect the correlation of 0.983 between them. Think of
                the overlapping area between them as the variation that they
                share, and the non-overlapping parts as variation in babies per

            <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Now, the overlap of the yellow and blue
              circles with the red life expectancy circle represents the amount
              of variation in life expectancy that is explained by birth rate
              and babies per woman. Because the correlation between the
              predictors is high, most of the variation in life expectancy that
              is explained is due to the variation that is shared between the
              predictors. But, you can see that the blue sliver also overlaps
              life expectancy, whereas the yellow sliver does not. This shows
              that, even though there is very little independent variation
              between the predictors, the independent part of birth rate
              explains variation in life expectancy, but the independent part of
              babies per woman does not. So, this means that the amount of
              correlation between the predictors is the cause of the problem,
              but the result of including two correlated predictors in a model
              depends on whether it is the shared part of the predictors or the
              independent parts that explain variation in the response.</td>

              <p>That's easy enough to illustrate, but let's look at how this
                works with the actual data. The two predictor variables are
                plotted to the right. The regression line represents the shared
                variation (i.e. the overlap in the yellow and blue circles), and
                the distances from points to the line are the independent
                variation (the parts of the yellow and blue circles that don't
                overlap).</p>

                  variation in life expectancy, so the predicted values should
                  be significant. The residuals are the variation in babies per
                  woman that is independent of birth rate, so the residuals

      <p>If you want to try this out yourself, you can run the commands below in
        the Rgui window - enter each one at the command prompt (&gt;). If you
        just want the result, skip down to the ANOVA table, below.</p>
      <p>First, we would need a model of the relationship between
        Babies.per.woman and Birth.rate.</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">bpw.br.lm &lt;- lm(Babies.per.woman ~
          Birth.rate, data = gapminder)</span></p>
      <p>Now, we can pull the predicted values representing variation shared
        between babies per woman and birth rate using:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">bpw.shared &lt;- predict(bpw.br.lm)</span></p>
      <p>and we can pull out the residuals representing variation in babies per
        woman that is independent of birth rate:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">bpw.independent &lt;- residuals(bpw.br.lm)</span></p>
      <p>Now let's see whether it's the shared part or independent part of
        babies per woman that's associated with life expectancy. Fit the model:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">bpw.lm &lt;- lm(Life.expectancy ~ bpw.shared
          + bpw.independent, data = gapminder)</span></p>
      <p>We can get the ANOVA table using:</p>
      <p><span class="rout rcmd">Anova(bpw.lm)</span></p>
      <p>which gives us this ANOVA table:</p>
      <p><span class="rout">Response: Life.expectancy<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Sum Sq&nbsp; Df&nbsp; F value

      <p> </p>
      <p>You'll see that the bpw.independent line has the same p-value as babies
        per woman had when it was in a model with birth rate - in both cases
        what is being tested is the ability of babies per woman to predict life
        expectancy, above and beyond what birth rate can predict. Most of the
        variation in life expectancy that babies per woman is able to predict is
        shared with birth rate, so the independent part of babies per woman
        isn't significant.</p>
      <p>What about birth rate? Would we expect only the shared part of birth
        rate to explain variation in life expectancy?</p>
      <p> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('pred_resid_br')">Click here to

      <div style="display:none;" id="pred_resid_br">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> We got a significant effect
          of birth rate on life expectancy even when babies per woman was also
          included - this suggests that both the shared part and the independent
          part of birth rate are important predictors of life expectancy.<br>
          <br>
          If we express birth rate as shared variation (br.shared) and
          independent variation (br.independent) and use these as predictors of
          life expectancy, we get just what we would expect: <br>
