      <p>Our next review exercise will focus on ANOVA and simple linear
        regression. You learned to do these in your introductory statistics
        classes, but they were probably taught as two distinct types of
        analysis, one that is good for comparing means between groups (ANOVA),
        and one that is good for measuring the straight-line relationship
        between two numeric variables (regression). For interpretation of
        results, ANOVA focuses on differences between group means, and
        regression focuses on the slope (which is the measure of change in the
        response per unit change in the predictor variable) and the coefficient
        of determination (r<sup>2</sup>, which measures the strength of the
        relationship between predictor and response).</p>
      <p>Even though they seem to be really different, one hint that regression
        and ANOVA share an underlying similarity is that we produce an ANOVA
        table for both of them. In both cases, we calculate how much variation
        in a measured <strong>response variable</strong> can be accounted for
        by a <strong>predictor variable</strong>. This is fairly obvious with a
        regression analysis, because both the predictor and response are numeric
        - in any regression data set they will each be in a column, with the
        variable name used as the column header. It's less obvious with ANOVA,
        because it is possible to arrange ANOVA data with a column of data for
        each group being compared. However, it is better to think of ANOVA as
        having a numeric response variable, which are all stored in one column,
        and a categorical predictor, stored in another column. The categorical
        predictor is called a <strong>factor</strong> by R, and factors are
        made up of the groups that are being compared (the <strong>levels</strong>
        of the factor). If we were doing an experiment on crop yield for fields
        fertilized with one of three different fertilizers, we would put all the
        measurements of yield into one column (called Yield), and the three
        different fertilizers would all be in another (called Treatment, or
        something like that), with the type of fertilizer used on the fields
        being the levels. Each row of the data would be one field, with the
        fertilizer type indicated in the Treatment column, and the amount of
        crops harvested from the field recorded in the Yield column.</p>
      <p>So, if we consider both regression and ANOVA to be an analysis of the
        effects of a predictor variable on the response by our experimental
        subjects, the fact that both use an ANOVA table is easier to understand.
        In both cases, we partition the variation in the response variable into
        a component that can be explained by the predictor and a component that
        is unpredictable, random variation. We then compare these two different
        sources of variation with an F test. The ANOVA table collects and
        organizes all of the information needed for the F test into a standard
        form that allows the reader to see exactly how the p-value is obtained.
        As we will be learning shortly, the fact that ANOVA and regression both
        generate an ANOVA table is not a coincidence, they are actually special
        cases of the same <strong>linear model</strong>.</p>
      <p>But, for today we will review what you have already learned about ANOVA
        and regression - we will save the demonstration that ANOVA and
        regression are special cases of the same model for next week.</p>
      <h2 id="anova" class="part">One-way ANOVA</h2>
      <p> <img src="daphnia.jpeg" alt="Daphnia" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px">Daphnia
        are small aquatic organisms, like the one pictured to the left.
        Cyanobacteria are low-quality food for Daphnia because cyanobacteria
        produce toxins that slow down growth and development. Consequently,
        Daphnia fed on cyanobacteria have slow growth rates.</p>
      <p> However, over time it is expected that Daphnia living in water bodies
        that have high levels of cyanobacteria will evolve resistance to
        cyanobacterial toxins, so that they can take advantage of the abundant
        food source. Hairston and colleagues (1999) tested this hypothesis
        experimentally by measuring the rate of weight gain in Daphnia fed on
        cyanobacteria, using individuals that came from lakes with high, medium,
        or low densities of cyanobacteria. Weight gain rate is used as an
        indication of resistance to cyanobacteria toxins, with large rates of
        weight gain indicating high levels of resistance. </p>
      <p>1. Start RStudio, and create a new project called "review2". Download
        the <a href="review_data.xls">Excel file</a> with today's data sets
        into the project folder. Download <a href="review2.Rmd">this</a> R
        markdown file and place it in the review2 folder, then open it in R
        Studio.</p>
      <p>Then, import the worksheet "anova" from "review_data.xls" into a data
        set called "daphnia". Enter the import command in the code chunk called
        "anova.import.data" of your <strong>R markdown file</strong> (you need
        to load the readxl library and then import the anova worksheet).</p>
      <p>Once the daphnia data set is in your environment click on its name to
        open it for viewing. If you look at how the data are organized, you'll
        see that you have one column called "cyandensity" that indicates the
        cyanobacteria density where the Daphnia was sampled, and "resistance"
        gives the growth rate of the Daphnia. Each row is a replicate, which in
        this case is an individual Daphnia. To address Hairston's question we
        will need to compare the means between high, medium, and low
        cyanobacteria densities - with three group means to compare, we will use
        an ANOVA. Provided that growth rate is highest where cyanobacteria are
        the most abundant, you would conclude that the difference indicates
        increased resistance to cyanobacterial toxins.</p>
      <p>2. We are going to make a graph of the data, but strangely enough there
        is not a graph type in "base" R that plots means and error bars. Yes,
        this is strange, since this is a dead standard kind of graph for grouped
        data, which is an extremely common type of data. But, one of the
        side-effects of using a programming language to do data analysis is that
        some seemingly pretty basic things are left up to you to do yourself.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Adding capabilities to R</h3>
        <p>When there is something you need to do in R that is not part of <strong>base</strong>
          R you have several options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do the calculations step by step with functions that are included
            in R</li>
          <li>Write your own functions</li>
          <li>Install an extension library that has the capabilities you need</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What we need in order to plot means with standard errors for the
          error bars is a table that gives each level of cyandensity, a mean
          resistance for each, and a standard error for each mean resistance. R
          provides a function called aggregate() that can be used to make the
          table we need, but it will require several steps. The syntax for
          aggregate() is (don't write this yet, just explaining still): </p>
        <p>aggregate(formula, data, function.to.use)</p>
        <p>The simplest way to use aggregate() to calculate one of the
          statistics we need, such as the mean (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
        <p class="rcmd">aggregate(resistance ~ cyandensity, data = daphnia, FUN
          = mean) -&gt; resistance.mean</p>
        <p>You can read the formula, resistance ~ cyandensity, as "resistance
          grouped by cyandensity", so this will calculate mean resistance for
          each cyandensity group. If you type the name resistance.mean in the <strong>console</strong>
          will see a table with mean resistances at the three cyanobacteria
          densities, like so<strong></strong>:</p>
        <p class="rout">&nbsp; cyandensity resistance<br>
          1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high&nbsp; 0.8000000<br>
          2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low&nbsp; 0.6833333<br>
          3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; med&nbsp; 0.7830000</p>
        <p>We could use aggregate() to calculate other statistics, such as the
          standard deviation (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
        <p class="rcmd">aggregate(resistance ~ cyandensity, data = daphnia, FUN
          = sd) -&gt; resistance.sd</p>
        <p>which gives us:</p>
        <p class="rout">&nbsp; cyandensity resistance<br>
          1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high 0.07859884<br>
          2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low 0.10333822<br>
          3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; med 0.04738729</p>
        <p>Those are standard deviations in the resistance column - one of the
          disadvantages of using aggregate() is that it uses the name of the
          variable as the column name, so you need to be careful to identify
          what the numbers are (we used .sd in the name of the object for that
          reason). To get the sample size we could use (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
        <p class="rcmd">aggregate(resistance ~ cyandensity, data = daphnia, FUN
          = length) -&gt; resistance.n</p>
        <p>Which gives us:</p>
        <p class="rout">&nbsp; cyandensity resistance<br>
          1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          high&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br>
          2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          low&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12<br>
          3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          med&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10</p>
        <p>You may be wondering, the length of what, exactly? The way aggregate
          works is to split the resistance data based on the cyandensity level,
          and feed one set of data at a time as a vector of numbers to the
          function we identify with FUN =. The length of a vector is the number
          of elements it contains, so the length of one of these subsets of
          resistance data is also the sample size for that group.</p>
        <p>Now we have pieces of the table we need in three different objects,
          and we need to assemble these into a single summary data set for
          graphing. We can do this with the data.frame() command (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
        <p class="rcmd">data.frame(cyandensity = resistance.mean$cyandensity,
          mean = resistance.mean$resistance, sd = resistance.sd$resistance, n =
          resistance.n$resistance, se =
          resistance.sd$resistance/sqrt(resistance.n$resistance)) -&gt;
          daphnia.sumstats</p>
        <p>Notice that in addition to making a column for each statistic and
          assigning the appropriate object's column to it, we calculated the
          standard error as well - the standard error is the standard deviation
          divided by the square root of the sample size, which is calculated and
          assigned to a column called se as the last part of our data frame.</p>
        <p>If you open daphnia.sumstats you will see:</p>
        <p class="rout">&nbsp; cyandensity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          mean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sd&nbsp;
          n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; se<br>
          1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high 0.8000000 0.07859884
          10 0.02485514<br>
          2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low 0.6833333
          0.10333822 12 0.02983117<br>
          3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; med 0.7830000
          0.04738729 10 0.01498518</p>
        <p>This is exactly what we need - took several steps, and created
          several objects to get it, but there it is!</p>
        <h3>Or, use an extension library</h3>
        <p>Rolling your own solution helps you learn R, but we can take
          advantage of the massive number of contributed libraries available for
          R, and find a function that does this data summary for us. There is
          such a command, called summarySE(), in the Rmisc library - load the
          library with the command:</p>
        <p>library(Rmisc)</p>
        <p>and you will have a command called summarySE() available that
          produces all of these statistics, and a 95% confidence interval to
          boot.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Okay, then, to get the summary statistics you need for your graph add
        these commands to the daphnia.sumstats chunk in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>:
      </p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(Rmisc)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summarySE(daphnia, "resistance", "cyandensity") -&gt;
        daphnia.sumstats</p>
      <p> In the daphnia.sumstats data set you now have the cyandensity labels
        we need for the x-axis, the means we need for y-axis, and the standard
        errors we need for the error bars (as well as a sample size, N, the
        standard deviation, sd, and the uncertainty value needed for a 95%
        confidence interval, ci). We are ready to graph them.</p>
      <p>3. Now we will plot the means found in the daphnia.sumstats data frame.
        We will use ggplot2 again, and the following instructions help you learn
        how ggplot() works by building the graph one step at a time. For each
        new version of the command just edit the previous one until you have
        your final graph (don't write a separate graph command for each one,
        you'll just have one graph with all the bells and whistles at the end).</p>
      <p>We will use daphnia.sumstats, and will assign cyandensity levels to the
        x axis, and the mean resistance values to the y-axis. In your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>, in the daphnia.plot.means chunk, enter the
        lines:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean))</p>
      <p>and submit the code chunk. You'll see a graph with cyandensities on the
        x-axis, a y-axis labeled "mean", and with nothing in it. This is because
        so far all we did was load the library, and then use the ggplot()
        command to identify the data set (daphnia.stats) and which variables to
        use for the x and y axes (the aesthetic mappings, aes()), but we haven't
        added anything to the plot yet. </p>
      <p>We will represent the means with points, so we need to add those to our
        ggplot() command - <strong><em>modify the command</em></strong> you
        entered already to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_point()</p>
      <p>The plus sign extends the ggplot() command - we are adding points as a
        geometric object (geom) to the plot. We now have a point for each mean
        on the plot. We can change the appearance of the points by adding some
        arguments to the geom_point() command - we can make them big and red
        with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_point(size = 3, color = "red")</p>
      <p>To add the error bars we add an additional geom, using geom_errorbar():</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_point(size = 3, color = "red") + geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = mean +
        se, ymin = mean - se))</p>
      <p>The geom_errorbar() command also has an aes() within it, which sets the
        top of the errorbar (ymax) to be the mean for each point plus the
        standard error for each point, and the minimum to be the mean minus the
        standard error. Bear in mind that both mean and se are columns in our
        data set, so when we calculate the top and bottom in the aes() statement
        we use the mean and se for each row, which are all different numbers.</p>
      <p>The error bars are a little wide and are drawing over the points. We
        can make the points draw over the error bars by moving the
        geom_errorbar() statement before the geom_point() statement:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = mean + se, ymin = mean - se)) + geom_point(size
        = 3, color = "red")</p>
      <p>and we can make the widths look better by setting their width within
        the geom_errorbar() command - note that we will want this width to apply
        to all of the error bars, and the width isn't present in a column in the
        data set, so we put it outside of the aes() statement:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = mean + se, ymin = mean - se), width = 0.1) +
        geom_point(size = 3, color = "red")</p>
      <p>which looks much nicer. Finally, the labels are variable names, which
        are okay for analysis but don't make a lot of sense for a graph (the
        y-axis plots resistance, and the points are the means, but the y-axis
        isn't the mean of resistance - confusing at best, inaccurate at worst).
        We can change the labels using the labs() command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(daphnia.sumstats, aes(x = cyandensity, y = mean)) +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = mean + se, ymin = mean - se), width = 0.1) +
        geom_point(size = 3, color = "red") + labs(x = "Cyanobacteria density",
        y = "Resistance")</p>
      <p>Based on this graph it looks like resistance to cyanobacterial toxins
        is greatest in "High" cyanobaceria densities, least in "Low" densities,
        and in between at moderate densities.</p>
      <p>4. We need to fix the order of the levels of cyandensity on the graph -
        they are in alphabetical order, which doesn't match the order of the
        levels.</p>
      <p>Currently, cyandensity is an unordered <strong>factor</strong>, which
        is R's data type for a variable that is used for grouping. When you look
        at the data set all you see is the labels for each cyandensity level,
        but in addition to these text labels a factor also has a numbers
        assigned to each level that R uses internally, but does not display by
        default. In an un-ordered factor these numbers are assigned to the
        levels alphabetically, and their ordering is never used in data analysis
        (they are used for other purposes, such as picking colors on plots).
        When we have a factor that is ordinal like this one, we need to make an
        <strong>ordered factor</strong>, which assigns the underlying numbering
        to match the order of the labels. To do this go back to the
        daphnia.sumstats code chunk and add a command at the end that says:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">daphnia.sumstats$cyandensity &lt;-
        ordered(daphnia.sumstats$cyandensity, levels = c("low","med","high"))</p>
      <p>You won't see an obvious difference, but if you type
        daphnia.sumstats$cyandensity at the console you'll see that now the
        levels are listed in the correct order (low, med, high), with less than
        symbols between them to indicate the ordering assigned.</p>
      <p>If you run the daphnia.plot.means code chunk again the graph will show
        the levels in the correct order. This, by the way, is an example of why
        the Rmd system is so nice - if you decide to make a change in one
        command, you can then run each code chunk that comes after and your
        output will all reflect the change.</p>
      <p>5. Check your normality assumption and HOV assumption. This is done
        using the same commands as you used in your two-sample t-tests. We will
        be using the daphnia data frame for this - put these tests into
        daphnia.normality and daphnia.hov chunks of your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>.</p>
      <p>6. Now you can conduct the ANOVA. Because R is object-oriented we will
        be doing this analysis in two stages - first, the ANOVA model is
        calculated (or "fitted" in statistical modeling terminology), and once
        that is done the ANOVA table is obtained as a summary of the fitted
        model. To fit the model, in the daphnia.run.anova chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong> use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">daphnia.aov &lt;- aov(resistance ~ cyandensity, data =
        daphnia)</p>
      <p>The work is being done by the aov() function, which identifies the data
        set being used (data = daphnia), and specifies the <strong>model
          formula</strong>. We will be using these in all of our analyses,
        because they specify the dependent variable (on the left of the tilde)
        that is to be explained by one or more independent variables (on the
        right of the tilde). This model formula, resistance ~ cyandensity, says
        that we will explain variation in resistance as a function of the
        cyandensity levels.</p>
      <p>You won't see anything on the screen, because the output of the aov()
        function is put into the daphnia.aov object. If you type daphnia.aov at
        the <strong>console</strong> you'll see that the output isn't organized
        as an ANOVA table yet. To get an ANOVA table we need to apply the
        anova() command to the fitted model in daphnia.aov (in your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>, on the next line after the aov() command):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(daphnia.aov)</p>
      <p>Remember that when you do an ANOVA the p-value tells you if there is
        reason to think that there are differences between means, but with three
        or more means being compared you can't tell which are different - it
        could be that all three means are different from one another, but any
        combination of significant and non-significant differences between the
        pairs of means is possible. After receiving a p-value less than 0.05
        with our ANOVA we need to conduct a post-hoc procedure to determine
        which of the groups are different from which. You learned about Tukey
        tests in Biol 215, so we will stick with those for now.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h2> Naming objects </h2>
        <p> We have made a few objects, and I've been choosing names for them
          for you. Objects names can be anything (as long as you don't use
          characters like spaces, quotes, dollar signs, or other "reserved"
          characters that are used by R for other things), but they should be
          sensible. Notice that I used a name for the dataset that told us
          something about what it contained (rather than something generic, like
          dataset1). Each time we created objects from an analysis of those data
          we used the name of the dataset first, followed by a period, followed
          by something that indicated what that object contained. For example,
          daphnia.sumstats tells us that object contains summary statistics for
          the daphnia data.</p>
        <p>When you're using Rmd files you're less likely to confuse yourself
          with poor object naming, but even with an Rmd file to help you
          document your work it's always a good idea to make your code as
          self-documenting as possible. Adopting sensible naming practices
          helps.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To get Tukey post-hoc comparisons use the command (in your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>, anova.tukey code chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> TukeyHSD(daphnia.aov)</p>
      <p>You will see all three of the possible comparisons (med-low, high-low,
        high-med) listed, with a difference between the means (diff), a lower
        and upper limits to a confidence interval on the difference (lwr and
        upr), and a p-value. We will go over post-hocs in much greater detail in
        week 4, for now just identify which comparisons have p-values less than
        0.05 and consider those groups to be significantly different.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>You can interpret these differences in the context of your graph of
        means - if there is a statistically significant difference refer to the
        graph to see which mean is greater than which.</p>
      <h2 id="regression" class="part">Regression</h2>
      <p><img src="225px-Operophtera_brumata01.jpg" alt="Winter moths" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px">The
        worksheet "regression" has some (instructor generated) data on
        environmental temperature, abdomen temperature, and thorax temperature
        in winter moths. Winter moths are ectotherms that live in cold climates,
        yet are able to fly in the winter months by using a "pre-flight warmup"
        in which they move their wings to generate heat in their flight muscles.
        The high temperatures allow them to sustain the high rates of energy use
        that are needed to power flight. Because the heat is generated locally
        in the thorax, we expect that the temperature in other parts of the body
        that are far from the thorax (such as the abdomen) would not warm up,
        and should more closely match ambient temperature.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">1. Import the sheet "regression" into an R dataset
        called "moth". If you open the data set you'll see that there is a
        column for environmental temperature, which will be the independent
        variable, and then two different dependent variables, Thorax.temp and
        Abdomen.temp. We will do two different regression analyses, one for each
        body part.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">2. Before we analyze the data, we should plot it.
        If you open the moth data set you'll see that there are three columns,
        one called Env.temp, one called Thorax.temp, and one called
        Abdomen.temp. To make the graph we want to stack the thorax and abdomen
        temps, make a column that indicates which is which, and then use the
        environmental temps for each of the two body temperatures (that is,
        we'll need to duplicate Env.temp and stack one copy on top of the
        other). We can do all of this in a couple of steps.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">First, to stack the two body temperatures, in the
        moth.stack chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>, use the
        stack() command:</p>
      <p style="clear: both" class="rcmd">stack(moth, c(2,3)) -&gt; moth.stacked</p>
      <p style="clear: both">This stacks the two body temperature variables, and
        makes a column to indicate which is which. If you click on
        moth.stacked&nbsp; but it doesn't name them well, and doesn't include
        Env.temp yet. To add Env.temp we can use the data.frame() command (in
        your <strong>R markdown file</strong>, below the stack() command):</p>
      <p style="clear: both" class="rcmd">data.frame(Env.temp = moth$Env.temp,
        moth.stacked) -&gt; moth.stacked</p>
      <p style="clear: both">This command may seem like it shouldn't work,
        because we only had 10 rows for the Env.temp variable in moth, but 20
        rows in our moth.stacked data frame. However, when R is put in this
        position it will "recycle" the set of numbers from the shorter data set
        and use them again to fill in the gaps - this had the effect of
        duplicating the Env.temp values for us.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">Finally, the column names created by the stack()
        command aren't very good - "values" for the body temperatures, and "ind"
        for the body parts - so let's fix that. We can ask for the names in a
        data frame with the command (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p style="clear: both" class="rcmd">names(moth.stacked)</p>
      <p style="clear: both">You will see the three column names reported. We
        can assign new names like so (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p style="clear: both" class="rcmd">names(moth.stacked) &lt;-
        c("Env.temp","Body.temp","Body.part")</p>
      <p style="clear: both">The names() function on the left accesses the names
        in moth.stacked, and we use the assignment operator (&lt;-) to set these
        to the names we want to use. If you look at moth.stacked (click on the
        name in your Environment) you'll see the three columns with these new
        names.</p>
      <p style="clear: both">3. We can set up the ggplot() command using
        environmental temperature as the x-axis variable, and one of the two
        response variables as the y-axis - we will use abdomen temperature. In
        the moth.plot chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong> enter:</p>
      <p style="clear: both" class="rcmd">ggplot(moth.stacked, aes(x = Env.temp,
        y = Body.temp, group = Body.part, color = Body.part)) + geom_point()</p>
      <p style="clear: both">You'll see the body temperatures plotted, color
        coded by the body part - with a numeric x-axis and a numeric y-axis this
        is a <strong>scatter plot</strong>. Based on this graph it looks like
        abdomen temperature changes as the environmental temperature changes,
        but thorax temperature does not. </p>
      <p>4. Now we can run the regression analysis. The function that fits a <strong>linear
          model</strong> (i.e. a straight line) to the data is called lm(), and
        it is a lot like the aov() function we used above - we identify a data
        set, and a model formula to get our fitted model (in the moth.run.lm
        chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(Abdomen.temp ~ Env.temp, data = moth) -&gt; abdomen.lm</p>
      <p> The object abdomen.lm is the <strong>fitted model</strong> for the
        relationship between abdomen temperature and environmental temperature.
        Just like with the ANOVA, though, the contents of the fitted model is
        not the ANOVA table that we need for our significance test. We will get
        the ANOVA table we need shortly.</p>
      <p>First, though, repeat this procedure with thorax temperature - in the
        next line of the same code chunk write the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(Thorax.temp ~ Env.temp, data = moth) -&gt; thorax.lm</p>
      <p>run this command and you will now also have an object called thorax.lm
        in your Environment.</p>
      <p>5. The ANOVA table is obtained with the command (in the
        moth.anova.tables chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(abdomen.lm)</p>
      <p>Note that the response variable is given above the table, and the table
        itself has the test of significance for environmental temperature as a
        predictor of abdomen temperature.</p>
      <p>You can do the same with thorax.lm to get its ANOVA table. You'll see
        that (as we thought) abdomen temperature increases significantly with
        environmental temperature but thorax temperature does not.</p>
      <p>6. To get r<sup>2</sup> and the regression equation we need to ask for
        a summary() of each fitted model. Try getting the summary() of
        abdomen.lm (enter the command in the moth.regression.coeff chunk of your
        <strong>R markdown</strong> file), and you should see this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call: <br>
        lm(formula = Abdomen.temp ~ Env.temp, data = moth) <br>

      <p> You'll find the r<sup>2</sup> labeled "Multiple R-squared" - ignore
        adjusted r<sup>2</sup> for now, we'll learn about it later. The
        regression equation is built from the coefficients listed in this output
        - you'll see them listed as the "Estimate" for (Intercept) and Env.temp.
        A straight line equation is mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the
        y-intercept. Our predictor variable here is environmental temperature,
        so the regression equation for abdomen temperature is:</p>
      <p>Abdomen.temp = -0.31194 + 1.01080 Env.temp</p>
      <p>The coefficients are each reported with tests of the hypothesis that
        they are equal to 0 - you'll see that the test of the slope has a
        p-value that is equal to that in the ANOVA table - it is highly
        statistically significant. The intercept is not different from zero.
        This tells us that the slope is very close to 1, and the intercept is
        not significantly different from 0.</p>
      <p>You can do the same set of steps to get r<sup>2</sup> and coefficients
        for thorax temperature and put together the regression equation for that
        model.</p>
      <p>7. Now, before we finish let's add the regression lines to the graph
        you made. Go back to the ggplot() command that you used to plot the moth
        data, and we will modify it with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(moth.stacked, aes(x = Env.temp, y = Body.temp,
        group = Body.part, color = Body.part)) + geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)</p>
      <p>This is the same command as above, except that we added a geom_smooth()
        to the plot. A geom_smooth() is a line fit through a data set, and the
        "lm" method of finding the line is a simple linear regression. Grouping
        by body part (the group = Body.part added to the aes() statement) causes
        R to calculate a different line for each body part, and the
        geom_smooth() command specifies that the lines should be straight
        (method = "lm") and the standard error bands should not be used (se =
        F). If you want to see what the graph looks like with the standard error
        bands you can remove the se = "F" setting and re-run the graph - it
        places a band around the line indicating uncertainty about where the
        population line would fall.</p>
      <p>Based on your regression analysis you now know that the relationship
        between environmental temperature and abdomen temperature is
        significant, but environmental temperature and thorax temperature is
        not. </p>
