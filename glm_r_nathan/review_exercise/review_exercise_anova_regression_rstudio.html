      <p>Our next review exercise will focus on ANOVA and simple linear
        regression. As we will be learning shortly, ANOVA and regression seem to
        be two distinct types of analysis, one that compares means between two
        or more groups and one that uses a straight line to model the
        relationship between two numeric variables, but in fact they are both
        special cases of the same <strong>linear model</strong>. The only hint
        of this underlying sameness from what you know already is that both
        ANOVA and regression use an ANOVA table to assess statistical
        significance. Both use a predictor variable (a categorical variable
        indicating groups in ANOVA, and the numeric variable that is
        experimentally set in regression) to explain variation in the response.
        Variation in the response is partitioned into a component that is
        explained by the predictor, and a component that is unexplained,
        individual random variation. Comparison of the amount of variation
        explained to the amount of variation unexplained, in the form of an F
        ratio, is the basis for assessing statistical significance. An ANOVA
        table compiles all the information needed to do the calculations
        required to do the F-test.</p>
      <h2 id="anova" class="part">One-way ANOVA</h2>
      <p>Cyanobacteria are low-quality food for zooplankton, such as Daphnia.
        However, over time it is expected that Daphnia living in water bodies
        that have high levels of cyanobacteria will evolve resistance to their
        toxins, so that they can take advantage of an otherwise abundant food
        source. Hairston and colleagues (1999) tested this hypothesis
        experimentally by measuring the rate of weight gain in Daphnia fed on
        cyanobacteria, using individuals that came from lakes with high, medium,
        or low densities of cyanobacteria. Weight gain rate is used as an
        indication of resistance to cyanobacteria toxins.</p>
      <p>The data we need for this exercise are in the same Excel sheet that you
        used last time.</p>
      <p>1. Start RStudio, and create a new project called "review2". Then,
        import the worksheet "anova" into a data set called "anova". </p>
      <p>2. We are going to make a graph of the data, but strangely enough there
        is not a graph type in "base" R that plots means and error bars. To make
        this kind of graph we will need to load a contributed add-on package
        called gplots, which has a function called plotmeans() that will make
        the graph we need.</p>
      <p>The gplots package has already been installed, but it isn't loaded for
        use. To load the package, switch to the Packages tab (in the same tab
        panel as Files and Help), and find the gplots package. Check the box
        next to it, and it will be loaded for use (you will see confirmation in
        the Console that gplots has been "attached" for use. You'll also see
        that it a command called lowess is masked - this means that gplots has a
        command with the same name as one that is already loaded, and thus the
        one in gplots will now be used instead. We won't use the lowess()
        command, so this is not a problem for us).</p>
      <p>3. To make the plot, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plotmeans(resistance ~ cyandensity, data = anova)</p>
      <p>The sample sizes reported on the graph overlap the bars, so let's get
        rid of them:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plotmeans(resistance ~ cyandensity, n.label = F, data =
        anova)</p>
      <p>4. We need to fix the order of the levels of cyandensity on the graph -
        they are in alphabetical order, which doesn't match the actual order of
        the levels.</p>
      <p>Currently, cyandensity is an unordered <strong>factor</strong>, which
        is R's data type for a variable that is used for grouping. When you look
        at the data set all you see is the labels for each cyandensity level,
        but in addition to these text labels a factor also has a number that
        identifies them that R does not display by default. In an unordered
        factor these numbers are assigned to the levels alphabetically, and
        their ordering is never used in data analysis (they are used for other
        purposes, such as picking colors on plots). When we have a factor that
        is ordinal like this one, we need to make an ordered factor, which
        assigns the underlying numbering to match the order of the labels. To do
        this use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ordered(anova$cyandensity, levels=c("low","med","high"))</p>
      <p>You will see in the console that the labels are reported, and their
        ordering is shown below as Levels: low &lt; med &lt; high, indicating
        that the order matches the labels, rather than being in alphabetical
        order.</p>
      <p>To assign this ordered factor back into the cyandensity variable,
        thereby replacing the unordered factor with an ordered factor, recall
        the command and change it to:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova$cyandensity &lt;- ordered(anova$cyandensity,
        levels=c("low","med","high"))</p>
      <p>If you make the graph again (using the same command - recall it and hit
        enter) you'll see the levels are now in the correct order.</p>
      <p>5. Check your normality assumption and HOV assumption.</p>
      <p>6. Now you can conduct the ANOVA. Because R is object-oriented we will
        be doing this analysis in two stages - first, the ANOVA model is
        calculated, and once that is done the ANOVA table is obtained as a
        summary of the fitted model. To fit the model, use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">aov(resistance ~ cyandensity, data = anova)</p>
      <p>This will dump some output to the screen, but you won't recognize it as
        an ANOVA. Recall the command and assign this fitted model to an object
        called daphnia.aov.</p>
      <p>Next, to get the ANOVA table, do a summary on daphnia.aov:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summary(daphnia.aov)</p>
      <p>To get Tukey post-hoc comparisons use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> TukeyHSD(daphnia.aov)</p>
      <p>7. To interpret an ANOVA properly it's important to have means and some
        measure of sampling variation (standard error, or a 95% confidence
        interval). R does not have a built-in function for making the summary
        table we would like, but since R is a programming language it's possible
        to put R commands into a <strong>script</strong> (which is just another
        name for a simple program) that defines a new function that does what we
        want. I have bundled several commands that we will use during the
        semester into a <strong>library</strong>, which is what R calls add-on
        packages that extend R's capabilities. The library is called "biol531",
        and can be loaded either by checking the box next to its entry in the
        Packages tab.</p>
      <p>To use the new function, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summarySE(anova, measurevar = "resistance", groups =
        "cyandensity")</p>
      <p>The command takes the name of a data set (which we called anova), a
        measured variable, and one or more grouping variables. You will see a
        table that gives the three levels of cyandensity with means, standard
        deviations (sd), sample sizes (n), standard errors (se) and the lower
        and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval for the means.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>8. Answer the questions on your worksheet. </p>
      <h2 id="regression" class="part">Regression</h2>
      <p>The worksheet "regression" has some (instructor generated) data on
        environmental temperature, abdomen temperature, and thorax temperature
        in winter moths. Winter moths are ectotherms that live in cold climates,
        yet are able to fly in the winter months by using a "pre-flight warmup"
        in which they move their wings to generate heat in their flight muscles.
        The high temperatures allow them to sustain the high rates of energy use
        that are needed to power flight. Because the heat is generated locally
        in the thorax, we expect that the temperature in other parts of the body
        that are far from the thorax (such as the abdomen) would not warm up,
        and should more closely match ambient temperature.</p>
      <p>1. Import the sheet "regression" into an R dataset called "regression".</p>
      <p>2. We would like to make a graph of the data with the regression line,
        but we need to run the regression first - this is a bit of a departure,
        in that we'll do the analysis first before looking at the data, but only
        so that we can make a suitable graph. We won't try to interpret the
        regression until we're sure the data follow a straight line relationship
        on the graph.</p>
      <p>One of the things that R Studio makes easy to do is to compile all of
        the commands we use into a script file so we can repeat the analysis
        later. It also makes it easier to fix mistakes, since we can just edit
        commands that didn't work and re-issue them.</p>
      <p>So, make a new script, and into it write:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(Abdomen.temp ~ Env.temp, data = regression) -&gt;
        abdomen.lm</p>
      <p> With your cursor positioned someplace on this line, hit the "Run"
        button, and you will see a new object called abdomen.lm added to your
        environment. This is the "fitted model" for the relationship between
        abdomen temperature and environmental temperature.</p>
      <p>Repeat this procedure with thorax temperature:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(Thorax.temp ~ Env.temp, data = regression) -&gt;
        thorax.lm</p>
      <p>We will build the plot we want in several lines - the first will plot
        abdomen temperature against environmental temperature using red-filled
        circles as plot symbols:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">plot(Abdomen.temp ~ Env.temp, data = regression, pch = 21,
        bg = "red") </p>
      <p>The pch argument is short for "plot character", and character number 21
        is a filled circle. The bg argument sets the color for the background of
        the plot character.</p>
      <p>To add the points for thorax temperature write the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">points(Thorax.temp~Env.temp, data = regression, pch = 21,
        bg = "green") </p>
      <p>Now we can add the lines using the abline() command, which extracts the
        slope and intercept from a fitted model and uses them to plot a line on
        the current graph. Add the lines:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">abline(abdomen.lm, col = "red")</p>
      <p class="rcmd">abline(thorax.lm, col = "green")</p>
      <p>and run each one. You should now have a red line through the red dots
        and a green line through the green dots.</p>
      <p>To add a legend identifying which data set is which use the legend()
        command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">legend(60,50,c("Abdomen","Thorax"), pch=21, pt.bg =
        c("red","green")) </p>
      <p>Based on this graph you'll see that abdomen temperature increases with
        environmental temperature, but thorax temperature doesn't seem to. We
        can get the ANOVA tables for these regressions to confirm that our
        impressions from the graph are correct in the next step.</p>
      <p>2. You already have the fitted models, but you still need to get the
        ANOVA tables, as well as the r<sup>2</sup> and regression equation for
        each model.</p>
      <p>The ANOVA table is obtained with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(abdomen.lm)</p>
      <p>You can do the same with thorax.lm to get its ANOVA table. You'll see
        that (as we thought) abdomen temperature increases significantly with
        environmental temperature but thorax temperature does not.</p>
      <p>We do not yet have the r<sup>2</sup> and regression equation, which we
        can get using the summary() command - try this on each fitted model. The
        output for abdomen looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call: <br>
        lm(formula = Abdomen.temp ~ Env.temp, data = regression) <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Residuals: <br>

        F-statistic:&nbsp; 3241 on 1 and 8 DF,&nbsp; p-value: 1.006e-11</p>
      <p> You'll find the r<sup>2</sup> labeled "Multiple R-squared" - ignore
        adjusted r2 for now, we'll learn about it later. The regression equation
        is not assembled for you, but the estimates of the slope and intercept
        coefficient are presented - intercept is labeled as such, and slope is
        named for the predictor variable. The regression equation is thus:</p>
      <p>Abdomen.temp = -0.31194 + 1.01080 Env.temp</p>
      <p>The coefficients are each reported with tests of the hypothesis that
        they are equal to 0 - you'll see that the test of the slope has a
        p-value that is equal to that in the ANOVA table - it is highly
        statistically significant. The intercept is not different from zero.
        This tells us that the slope is very close to 1, and the intercept is
        not significantly different from 0.</p>
      <p>You can look at the estimates for thorax temperature and put together
        the regression equation for that model.</p>
