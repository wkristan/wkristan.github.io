      <h2 id="r-background" class="part">A little background on R</h2>
      <p>The statistical package we are using for this class is free of charge.
        The reason why this is the case is interesting, and before we start on
        the exercise, you should know a little about the software.</p>
      <p>R is an "open source" implementation of the S+ statistical computing
        language, and is available for several different computing platforms
        (Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems). Open
        source software is developed in a collaborative way by teams of
        programmers, often on a volunteer basis. There are many reasons that
        programmers choose to participate in open source projects, but from a
        user's perspective there are several practical advantages to using open
        source software. The first is that the "source code" written by the
        programmers can be reviewed by other programmers, or even by users if
        they choose, which provides a form of peer review. Peer review is an
        important quality control mechanism in scientific work, and it has the
        same effect in software development. The second benefit to users is that
        this openness promotes a cooperative attitude, which can lead to a
        tremendous amount of contributed code; the benefit of this becomes
        obvious both through R's impressive feature set, as well the huge number
        of contributed extensions that allow R to perform some very specialized
        types of data analysis, from estimating home ranges from animal point
        locations, to analysis of genomics experiments. You can see the list of
        available add-on packages <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">here</a>,
        grouped by the type of problem the add-on is useful for addressing (as
        of this writing, there are over 10,000 contributed packages available).
        Finally, because the code is contributed for free, open source software
        is usually distributed free of charge, which is true of R.</p>
      <p>R is a flexible, comprehensive platform for statistical analysis and
        graphics. It is extremely powerful, but by itself it is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span>
        user friendly. The graphical user interface (GUI) that is distributed
        with R for Windows helps with only for very rudimentary things, such as
        management of extension packages, but the statistical analysis functions
        are accessed through a command-line interface (CLI). Graphical
        interfaces that have been written for R provide access to many of the
        most common statistical procedures, and we will make extensive use of
        one of them, called the R Commander. However, we will do some of our
        work at the command line, as some of the packages you might need to use
        at a later date do not have a graphical interface.</p>
      <h2 id="r-capabilities" class="part">What can R do?</h2>
      <p>Simply put, there is probably nothing you would want to do with data
        that R cannot do. It has a very comprehensive set of statistical
        functions for data analysis built in, and anything it doesn't do by
        default can be added with user-generated functions and extensions. A
        short, incomplete, list includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic data summary</li>
        <li>Basic statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, nonparametrics)</li>
        <li>Linear models (ANOVA, regression, logistic regression, loglinear
          analysis, etc.)</li>
        <li>Multivariate analysis (MANOVA, PCA, DFA)</li>
        <li>Graphics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User-contributed packages are available that vastly expand the basic
        capabilities. Another short, incomplete list that may be of interest to
        biologists includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monte Carlo simulations, randomization methods</li>
        <li>Kernel smoothing techniques</li>
        <li>Phylogenetic analysis</li>
        <li>Ordination methods (CCA, RDA, DCA, etc.)</li>
        <li>Genomic analyses</li>
        <li>Home range estimation and habitat use analysis</li>
        <li>Mark-recapture methods for estimating population size, survival
          probability</li>
      </ul>
      <p> One potential benefit of the platform, then, is that virtually any
        analysis one might want to do can be accomplished under one umbrella.
        Once you've taken the trouble to learn how to use R, you can use it for
        just about anything you might want to do with data. </p>
      <h2 id="rstudio" class="part">A kinder, gentler interface</h2>
      <p>If you download R and install and launch it, you will see a program
        that looks like <a href="rgui.png">this</a> (on Windows). The "R
        Console" is where commands are issued, and the the "GUI" that is
        distributed is very rudimentary - there are no menus for running
        statistical analyses or making graphs, like you get with MINITAB, and
        all of the menu selections and buttons are for opening and saving R's
        "workspaces", printing output, or managing add-on packages.</p>
      <p>Graphical interfaces have been developed that use R for all of the
        work, but allow the user to use menus and windows to do their work, but
        all of them have serious limitations. For example, the most polished
        interface available (in my opinion) is called Rkward, and its interface
        looks like <a href="rkward.png">this</a>. There are menus for analysis
        and plotting, and a spreadsheet-like data viewer. Rkward development has
        been very slow, however, and many of the analyses we will do in this
        class are not yet supported. Another popular option that I've used in
        this class before is called the "R Commander", which looks like <a href="r_commander.png">this</a>.
        Aside from the obvious problem that it's as ugly as the south end of a
        northbound dog, it too only supports some of R's capabilities, and
        doesn't handle such simple tasks as producing more than a single graph
        at a time with ease.</p>
      <p>Instead of using a full-blown graphical interface, we will be using an
        "integrated development environment" (or IDE) designed specifically for
        R, called R Studio. R Studio is not a graphical interface to R's
        statistical analysis, but it is a graphical interface to such useful
        things as accessing help files, browsing for and importing data files,
        managing graphs, and editing R commands. It is the tool I use in my own
        work. By using R Studio we will need to learn to do nearly everything at
        the command line, but R Studio will make this learning curve easier.</p>
      <h3>Starting R Studio and importing your first data set</h3>
      <p>Find R Studio in the Start menu, and launch it. You will see a window
        that looks like this:</p>
      <div id="rstudio_map"> <a href="#" id="console" class="tooltip"><span>Console</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="fileMenu" class="tooltip"><span>Menu bar (File menu)</span></a>

        <a href="#" id="helpTab" class="tooltip"><span>Help tab</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both">If you move your mouse over the picture above
        you'll see popups that indicate the location of the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Console - where R commands are entered, and output is displayed</li>
        <li>Menu bar - where the File menu is found (and other menus that we
          will learn about as needed) </li>
        <li>The Project menu - where projects can be created, opened, or closed</li>
        <li>Environment tab - where all the objects in our workspace will be
          displayed. The environment is active working space, in computer
          memory.</li>
        <li>History tab - a list of the commands used, which can be selected and
          re-used</li>
        <li>Files tab - where the files in the current working directory are
          displayed. These are files stored on disk, rather than being loaded in
          computer memory. We would need to load a data file from disk into
          memory for it to appear in the Environment, and to be usable by R.</li>
        <li>Plots tab - where any graphs we make will be viewed (and from where
          they can be exported)</li>
        <li>Packages tab - where add-on packages that are currently installed
          can be loaded for use</li>
        <li>Help tab - where help files can be searched and viewed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first thing we will do is to make a new project for our review
        exercise.</p>
      <h3 id="projects" class="part">Start a new project for this exercise</h3>
      <p>One of the best reasons to use R Studio is that it makes management of
        your work in R much easier. An excellent example of that is in its
        management of your R session. All of the data you import, and any
        results that you assign to "objects" within R will be saved in an R
        "workspace", which is a file that is saved to disk, usually called
        .RData (note the period before the R). R will also save a history file,
        called .Rhistory. However, all the other things that you create, such as
        your statistical output and graphs, do not get saved by R. To fix this,
        R Studio uses "projects", which are folders that contain everything you
        are working on in your R session, as well as a project file that keeps
        track of the state of your R Studio session the last time you saved it.
        When you open a project file, you will see your session in exactly the
        state you last saved it in, so that you can pick up where you left off.</p>
      <p>To make a new project, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "File" â†’ "New Project..."</li>
        <li>In the "Create Project" window, select "New Directory".</li>
        <li>In the "Project Type" window select "New Project".</li>
        <li>In the "Create New Project" window we will name the new folder
          (a.k.a. directory) that will contain our project:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter "review1" as the directory name. </li>
          <li>We also need to set the folder that contains the folder we are
            about to create, so click on "Browse" and navigate to your H: drive.
            Make a folder on H: for this class (with the "New folder" button),
            and then select that as the folder that will hold your new project
            folder.</li>
          <li>Click "Create Project" to create the new project.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you're done you'll see that the Environment tab is blank, except
        for a gray "Environment is empty" label, and the "Files" tab shows a
        review1.Rproj file (the new project file that R Studio just created),
        and nothing else. The thin status bar just above the "Name" label shows
        that you are looking at the contents of the new folder you just created
        on your H: drive. This is your "working directory", which R will use for
        output files, and where it will look for any input files unless you tell
        it otherwise.</p>
      <h3 id="import" class="part">Import data into an R data set</h3>
      <p>Download <a href="review_data.xls">this</a> file, and note where it
        goes (it probably went to the Downloads folder if your browser didn't
        ask you where to pit the file). All of the data sets you will use for
        this week and next week's review exercises in this file.</p>
      <p>We need to import the first worksheet into R, so we need to go find it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the environment tab, click on "Import Dataset", <img src="import_dataset.png"
            alt="Ellipses">, and then "From Excel", which will bring up the
          "Import Excel Data" window.</li>
        <li>Click on "Browse" to the right of the "File/Url:" box, navigate to
          where you put "review_data.xls" (probably Downloads), click on it and
          then click "Open".</li>
        <li>In the "Import Excel Data" window, set the "Name" to "onesample",
          and the "Sheet" to onesample. The "Name" is the name of the new R data
          set you will create, and the "Sheet" is the name of the worksheet in
          the review_data.xls file. You'll see a preview of the data, which
          should have a single column of data on body temperature.</li>
        <li>Click "Import"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data will be imported, and put into an <strong>object</strong>
        called "onesample", which you'll see in the Environment tab. The data is
        opened in a window above the Console window, so that you can view it.</p>
      <p>Note that at this point you have a project file saved into your folder,
        but this new R data set is not saved yet - it's in memory, but not yet
        saved to disk. When you quit R Commander it will ask you if you want to
        save the workspace into a file called .RData, but this hasn't been done
        yet, and if R Commander crashes you would lose your data set - the
        workspace is saved to a separate file from the project file. To save the
        workspace now, click the save icon, <img src="save.png" alt="Save workspace">,
        in the "Environment" tab and save the workspace as a file called
        ".RData" (watch the period and the capitalization). This is the default
        name for R workspaces, and R Studio will find it and load it
        automatically when you open the project later. You should now see a file
        called .RData in your "Files" tab.</p>
      <h2 id="objects_functions" class="part">Objects and functions</h2>
      <p>We are using R to analyze our data, but it is also an <strong>object-oriented
          programming language</strong>. Object-oriented programming refers to
        an approach to writing computer programs that attempts to mimic the way
        that we interact with physical objects. Real, physical objects have <strong>properties</strong>
        that define them (volume, shape, mass). When we want to accomplish a
        task, the way we accomplish the same task is different depending on the
        type of object we'll use - for example, if we want to go to Los Angeles
        we will drive if we have a car, and will fly if we have a helicopter.
        Object orientation means that when we make a data set in R it has
        properties and <strong>methods</strong>, which refers to the way that
        we accomplish a task for that object type.</p>
      <p>To interact with an object, like our onesample data set, we can use <strong>functions</strong>.
        Most functions take arguments that tell them what to operate on and set
        options for how to operate, and all functions return results. A function
        in R will have a name followed by parentheses with no spaces between the
        name and the left (open) parenthesis. Functions will often have <strong>default</strong>
        settings for their arguments, and if the default settings are what you
        want you can accept them by leaving the arguments blank. For example,
        the ls() function is used to list the contents of a workspace, and if
        you just want to list the contents of the current workspace (the
        default) you just need to type:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ls()</p>
      <p>at the &gt; prompt in the console, and you'll see the output:</p>
      <p class="rout">[1] "onesample"</p>
      <p>The [1] is an index number that tells us that onesample is the first
        (and in this case, only) object in the workspace (listed
        alphabetically).</p>
      <p>We will use functions on our onesample object as well - to get a
        statistical summary of the body temperature in onesample, use the
        command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summary(onesample)</p>
      <p>which will display a summary in the Console window. One of the nice
        features of R Studio that you'll notice as you type this command is <strong>code
          completion</strong>. As you type R Studio will match what you've
        written already to lists of possible command and will give you a pop-up
        list of commands to choose from. If you select the command you want from
        the list (with up and down arrow keys) and then hit the TAB key the
        selection will be entered for you. This works with names of objects, and
        names of variables within objects as well. I recommend you take
        advantage of this feature, because one of the biggest frustrations in
        learning to use R is that it is very fussy about spelling,
        capitalization, and syntax of commands, and using code completion will
        help you avoid typos. </p>
      <h2 id="one-sample_t" class="part">One-sample t-test</h2>
      <p>To review one-sample t-tests, you will test whether body temperature is
        different from 98.6 degrees. Imagine these data represent a set of body
        temperature measurements from a group of CSUSM students. Because you
        have a single sample of data, with a single mean body temperature, you
        will compare the mean of the data to a hypothetical value you specify
        using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>1. Check the assumptions of the test. If you recall, a one-sample
        t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed. We can check this
        using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test - it assumes the data are normally
        distributed as the null hypothesis, so a p-value over 0.05 indicates
        normality:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample$Body.temperature)</p>
      <p>The command is shapiro.test(), and it takes one argument, which is the
        variable that we want to test for normality. Note that we had to tell R
        both which data set to use, and which variable to use - if you tried
        shapiro.test(onesample) it would not work, even though there is only one
        variable, and if you tried shapiro.test(Body.temperature) it would not
        work because R wouldn't know which data set contained this variable,
        even though there is only one in the workspace. R is very literal.</p>
      <p>You'll see from the output of shapiro.test() that p is 0.1131, so we
        pass the normality assumption. </p>
      <p>This style of referring to a column in a data set - with the name of
        the data set followed by the name of the variable, separated by a dollar
        sign - is common, but not the only way available. We can refer to parts
        of a data set with a [row, column] index instead, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample[ , 1])</p>
      <p>Leaving the row number blank tells R to use all of the rows, but the 1
        in the column index tells R to use the first column in onesample for the
        test. Finally, we can use the with() command to identify the data set,
        and then nest the shapiro.test() command within it, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(onesample, shapiro.test(Body.temperature))</p>
      <p>I personally prefer the first or third method, because it makes the
        commands easier to understand.</p>
      <p>2. Before conducting a one-sample t-test, look at your data! A good
        choice for small to medium sized data sets (100 observations or less) is
        a "strip chart", which plots the individual data points (much like
        MINITAB's individual value plots). To make one, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stripchart(onesample$Body.temperature, xlab =
        "Temperature")</p>
      <p>You should have a plot that shows each individual data value along a
        horizontal line. The xlab argument sets the x-axis label.</p>
      <p>Another good type of graph to use to see the distribution of the data
        is a box plot, which you can get with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">boxplot(onesample$Body.temperature, ylab = "Temperature")</p>
      <p>Box plots show the smallest and largest non-extreme data values as <strong>whiskers</strong>,
        and three <strong>quartiles</strong> (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) as a box
        with a line in the middle. Quartiles are the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th
        percentiles, meaning that they are the values below which 25%, 50%, 75%,
        and 100% of the data values fall. The 2nd quartile is also called the
        median, and the 4th quartile is the maximum data value. The difference
        between the 3rd and 1st quartile is called the <strong>interquartile
          range</strong>, and if there are any data values that are more than
        1.5 times the interquartile range away from the bottom or top of the box
        they are considered <strong>extreme</strong> values. Extreme values are
        not necessarily errors, but they can cause problems for data analysis
        and boxplots flag them by plotting them with circles below the lower
        whisker or above the upper one. You can see there is one extreme value
        below the lower whisker, but none above, so the circle is the minimum,
        and the upper whisker is the maximum for the data set.</p>
      <p>3. Now you're ready to conduct the one-sample t-test. The command is:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6)</p>
      <p>Output is reported in the console, and should look like <a href="onesample_output.png">this.</a></p>
      <p>This command requires a data set to work on, and a numeric value to
        compare the sample mean of the data against. Note that the data set is
        given as the first argument without any kind of identifier, but the
        second argument is identified as the value of the population mean (mu)
        that we want to use. R commands will have a default order for arguments,
        and if you put the arguments in the correct order you do not have to
        identify them. The mu option is actually the fourth argument in this
        command, but since there are some optional arguments that we aren't
        specifying we need to use the mu = label to tell R what 98.6 refers to.
        To avoid giving the name of the option we could use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, , , 98.6)</p>
      <p>and since 98.6 is the fourth argument, with the commas holding the
        place of the second and third, the t.test() command works without
        needing to name 98.6 as the mu argument.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the choices we need to make when we do hypothesis testing is
        whether we want to do one-tailed or two-tailed testing. If we do
        one-tailed testing we are only interested in detecting a difference in a
        particular direction - if we were measuring these temperatures to find
        out if people in the class are running a fever we would only be
        interested in whether the sample mean is higher than 98.6, and we may
        want to do a one-tailed test. If instead we're checking whether 98.6 is
        an accurate normal body temperature, then differences that are either
        above or below the mean are of interest, and we would use a two-tailed
        test. We specify whether we are doing a one-tailed or two-tailed test by
        specifying the alternative hypothesis - if we are only interested in
        testing for increases in body temperature we would use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6, alternative
        = "greater")</p>
      <p>The default is to do two-tailed testing, so we don't need to specify an
        alternative if we are interested in differences that are either greater
        than or less than mu. </p>
      <p>If this distinction still does not make sense to you, read the review
        material on one-sample t-tests, above.</p>
      <h2 id="two-sample_t" class="part">Two-sample t-test</h2>
      <p>Charles Darwin was not only an important theoretician, he conducted
        many experiments to test his ideas on evolution by natural selection. On
        the page "twosample", you have some of Darwin's data on an experiment
        comparing the heights of a species of plant, the "mignonette", that can
        reproduce either by self-pollinating, or by using pollen from other
        individuals. Darwin experimentally selfed some plants and crossed
        others, and collected the resulting seed. He then planted seeds from
        each pollination treatment group, and measured the heights of the
        offspring. </p>
      <p>You now have data from two different groups, and would like to know if
        their means are different enough to conclude they come from statistical
        populations with different means - remember, the sample means are almost
        certainly not identical, but that's not what we are testing (why would
        we test if the sample means are different when they obviously are not?).
        We are testing if the population means are different, given the amount
        of difference we find between between these two sample means.</p>
      <p>1. Find the Excel sheet with the data and import the sheet called
        "twosample" into an R data set called "twosample". You'll see that we
        have two variables: Height (the height of the plants in cm) and
        Pollination (a grouping variable indicating if the plant was crossed or
        selfed). This arrangement of data, with groups indicated by a column
        called a "factor", is referred to as "stacked" data, and it's the
        arrangement we will use throughout the class.</p>
      <p>2. To make a strip chart of the height data grouped by pollination use
        the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stripchart(Height ~ Pollination, data = twosample)</p>
      <p>Note that this command allows us to use a formula statement to say that
        we want to plot Height as a function of Pollination, with the tilde
        character (found to the left of the 1 on the keyboard) taking the place
        of an equal sign. This style of statement is very common in R. The
        second argument identifies the data set, so we don't need to use
        twosample$Height or twosample$Pollination to identify the data set to
        use.</p>
      <p>To make a box plot for these data use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">boxplot(Height ~ Pollination, data = twosample, ylab =
        "Height (cm)")</p>
      <p>This command also uses the formula notation to group the heights by
        pollination group, and then adds an argument to set the label on the
        y-axis to "Height (cm)".</p>
      <p>3. We need to test the data for normality, but we need to do this by
        group - if the two pollination types are have a different mean then the
        data may be bimodal when the groups are combined, even though they are
        normal when they are split.</p>
      <p>R is able to apply functions to subsets of data using the tapply()
        function. The tapply() function takes a column of data as its first
        argument, a grouping variable as its second argument, and a function to
        be applied to each group as the third. We can do Shapiro-Wilk tests on
        each pollination group with:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, tapply(Height, Pollination, shapiro.test))</p>
      <p>You will see that R reports two different tests, one for each
        pollination group. We pass for both of them.</p>
      <p>4. Test the assumption of equal variances. Equal variances between
        groups is an assumption of the test, meaning that we can only trust our
        test of differences between the means to be accurate if we have equal
        variances (equal variances is not the biologically interesting question,
        therefore, we're just testing whether it's okay to use the t-test). </p>
      <p>To run Bartlett's test of homogeneity of variances (HOV) use the
        function:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, bartlett.test(Height, Pollination))</p>
      <p>If you fail to reject that hypothesis (that is, if p &gt; 0.05),
        consider the variances the same. </p>
      <p>5. Now that we know that we meet the normality and HOV assumptions we
        can test for differences in mean height between groups. The same
        function is used, but with different arguments:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(Height ~ Pollination, var.equal = TRUE,
        data=twosample)</p>
      <p>This version of the t.test() function says that Height is a function of
        Pollination group, that the test should assume equal variances, and that
        the data set containing the variables is twosample.</p>
      <p>6. Answer the questions on your assignment sheet.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Note that in addition to the p-value, R reports a confidence
        interval&nbsp;the difference between the means. If it has a negative
        lower bound and a positive upper bound, the difference could be zero,
        and you would fail to reject the null. If it has two negative or two
        positive bounds, zero is not included in the interval, and you could
        reject the null.</p>
      <h2 id="paired_t" class="part">Paired t-test</h2>
      <p>A classic paired data set is one in which the same experimental
        subjects are observed in two different experimental conditions. You have
        data on plant CO2 uptake in two different ambient CO2 concentrations
        (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The goal is to compare the uptake between these
        two concentrations, but since each of 12 plants are tested at each
        concentration, we would expect the uptake values not to be independent,
        because uptake at 250 ppm and at 500 ppm are likely to be more similar
        for the same plant than for other plants in the data set. This causes
        two different problems: a) if we treat the observations as independent,
        we will use a greater degrees of freedom than we actually have, which
        will make our p-values inaccurate, and b) a small but consistent
        increase in uptake from 250 ppm to 500 ppm could be obscured by a large
        amount of variation among plants. We will use a paired t-test to correct
        for this lack of independence, and solve both of these problems.</p>
      <p>1. Import the sheet called "paired" into an R data set also called
        "paired".</p>
      <p>2. We should look at the data, but we have a small problem - our charts
        want the data to be in a stacked arrangement, but these data are
        arranged side by side to facilitate the paired t-test we will do.
        Stacking the data would mean putting both sets of uptake values in a
        single column, with a second column that indicates the CO2 treatment. R
        has a function that does this for us:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3))</p>
      <p>This command takes the data set to be stacked as the first argument,
        and a <strong>vector</strong> of column numbers that should be stacked.
        Vectors are a single row or a single column of values, and R creates
        them using the c() command. The first column of the data set is just a
        plant ID label, which we don't need to plot, so we are just stacking the
        second and third columns. You'll see the result in the console.</p>
      <p>We have a small problem that we are only seeing the result in the
        console - a new data set is not created, because we didn't <strong>assign</strong>
        the result to a new object. We can fix this by recalling the command you
        just issued using the up arrow key, and then modifying the command like
        so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3)) -&gt; co2.stacked</p>
      <p>The arrow formed with a dash followed by a greater than symbol is an <strong>assignment
          operator</strong> which causes R to take the output of the function on
        the left side and assign it to the new object on the right side. You can
        also assign from right to left by making the arrow point in the other
        direction, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">co2.stacked &lt;- stack(paired, c(2,3))</p>
      <p>When you assign output to an object it is not reported to the console,
        but you should now see an object called co2.stacked in your environment.
        To see it in the console you can write its name at the command prompt:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">co2.stacked</p>
      <p>and its contents will be displayed. If you click once on co2.stacked in
        the Environment tab it will open in a data viewer tab so you can scroll
        through the data.</p>
      <p>3. The column names are not very useful - stack() assigned the name
        "value" for the uptake data, and "ind" (short for "index") for the CO2
        treatment. We can use the command colnames() to extract the column names
        that are currently assigned:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked)</p>
      <p>which will display the column names in the console. We can also use
        colnames() to change the names to other values with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked) &lt;- c("Uptake", "Treatment")</p>
      <p>This command assigns a vector with "Uptake" and "Treatment" as the
        column names for co2.stacked. If you have the stacked data open in a
        viewer you'll see the column names update to these new values.</p>
      <p>4. You now have a data set that you can use to make a strip chart and a
        box plot by group, so do so. You'll see that both of these plots show a
        small difference in the distribution of the data, but with lots of
        overlap. Remember, though, that the data are measurements of the same
        plants under two different CO2 concentrations, and the we're really only
        interested in whether each plant changes their CO2 uptake when the
        environment changes - we just need to know if the differences between
        plants are different from 0 on average.</p>
      <p>To get differences, we can use R's ability to operations on entire
        vectors of data - we can calculate differences between the two different
        CO2 treatments with the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250)</p>
      <p>The differences between each row of the paired data set is shown in the
        console. To add these differences back into the paired data set, recall
        the command and change it to:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250) -&gt; paired$diffs</p>
      <p>Your paired data set now has an additional column called "diffs",
        containing the differences. You can do a boxplot of these differences,
        and you'll see that all of them are positive.</p>
      <p>5. To check the normality assumption of a paired t-test, conduct a
        Shapiro-Wilk test on the differences you just calculated.</p>
      <p>6. Now that you know you meet the normality assumption, conduct a
        paired t-test using the same function, but with different options:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, t.test(uptake_250, uptake_500, paired =
        TRUE)) </p>
      <p>The paired t-test compares the mean of the differences between the two
        columns of data against 0, using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>7. Answer the questions on the assignment sheet.</p>
