      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Why summarize data?</h2>
      <p>Summarizing data necessarily involves selectively presenting
        information from a data set, and a poor choice of summary can be very
        misleading. You need to learn to select good summaries for data, but for
        the choices available to make sense you should start with the
        fundamental question: why summarize data at all?</p>
      <p>The reason we summarize data is that we are interested in deriving
        understanding from the data we collect, and strangely enough it can
        become more difficult to understand what data have to tell us the more
        data we have to work with unless we summarize it.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img alt="Small sample" src="small_sample.png" style="float:left;">Imagine
                that we were interested in comparing the heights of men and
                women in our class - we could measure all of the men and all of
                the women, and plot their heights in a simple graph. When we
                don't have too many observations we can display all of the data,
                lose no information, and see how the heights compare. Clearly,
                most men are taller than most women in this sample, but there is
                some overlap in height, because the tallest woman is taller than
                the shortest man. Based on this graph, though, we would probably
                be comfortable saying something like "in general, men are taller
                than women".</p>
              <br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">
              <p>This works fine for a small data set, but what if we had 10,000
                observations rather than ten for each sex? </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <img alt="Big sample" src="big_sample.png" style="float: left;">
              <p>The differences between men and women are still visible, but
                there appears to be more overlap in heights in this graph than
                in the first graph, because our large sample is including some
                unusually tall and unusually short individuals for each sex.
                Unfortunately, we can no longer see how many data points fall at
                each height, so we're losing some of our ability to judge what
                the typical heights are for the sexes. We could inspect the data
                in a spreadsheet, but that would only make the problem worse -
                it's even more difficult to discern patterns by inspecting
                thousands of rows of data than it is to observe them in a graph.</p>
            </td>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img alt="Violin" src="violin.png" style="float: left;">We can
                use a graphical method called a violin plot that draws a shape
                around the dots to indicate the density of points along the
                y-axis. You can see that in both of the sexes there is a clear
                concentration of data near the middle of the range of heights,
                and really tall and really short people are much less common.</p>
              <p>What is there to learn from these data about heights of men and
                women? The violin plot is showing that there is a typical value
                of height for each sex, at around 69 inches for men and around
                64 inches for women - we can say that men are generally taller
                than women by about 5 inches. We can also see that there is
                variation around each of these typical values, and the heights
                of men and women overlap quite a bit - some women are taller
                than the typical man, and some men or shorter than the typical
                woman.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>We can simplify our presentation of the data even further by selecting
        a single value that represents the typical data value, and one that
        represents variability in the data. In doing so we will choose not to
        base our understanding on inspection of the raw data, and instead to
        base it on some general attributes of the data sets, but in exchange we
        gain a clearer understanding of the general patterns the data show us.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img alt="Summary" src="summary.png" style="float: left;">The
                graph to the left is presenting a measure of where the middle of
                the data set is for each sex (the black dots), along with a
                measure of the range of heights that are typical for each sex
                (the t-shaped bars extending above and below each mean). With
                just a couple of carefully chosen pieces of information we can
                extract the essential information in the data, without getting
                overwhelmed by the details.</p>
              <p>But, there's a catch - summaries represent specific
                characteristics of the data, and if we base our conclusions on
                poorly chosen summaries we can mislead ourselves and others
                about what the data say. Obviously, we need to know how to
                select informative summaries, and to avoid picking misleading
                ones.</p>

      <h2 class="part" id="good_summaries">Picking appropriate summary
        statistics</h2>
      <p>Any value we calculate from our data is a <strong>statistic</strong>,
        and statistics that are meant to summarize and describe some important
        aspect of a data set are <strong>summary statistics</strong>, also
        called <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>.</p>
      <p>There are many summary statistics to choose from, but not all of them
        are appropriate for all data types. It's helpful to start off by making
        a distinction, then, between categorical variables and numeric
        variables. There are some additional considerations in picking good
        summaries for numeric variables, which we'll address after we look at
        summaries for categorical variables.</p>
      <h3>Summarizing categorical variables</h3>
      <p>For categorical variables, the choice is pretty simple - the best
        summary statistics for categorical variables are <strong>frequencies</strong>
        and <strong>relative frequencies</strong>. If we counted the number of
        male and female bears in the data set we used in our first activity, we
        would present the numbers in a <strong>frequency table</strong>, like
        this: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <table class="tableLarge">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th align="left">Sex </th>
            <th>Frequency </th>
            <th>Relative frequency </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td align="left">Female</td>
            <td>44</td>
            <td>0.308</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td align="left">Male</td>
            <td>99</td>
            <td>0.692</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Total</td>
            <td>143</td>
            <td>1</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The relative frequencies are also given, which are just the frequencies
        divided by the total. The sum of the frequencies equals the total number
        of data points in the data set. Since the relative frequencies are
        proportions of the total, they will always sum to 1. </p>
      <p>You can convert relative frequencies to percentages by multiplying by
        100 - so, 30.8% of the bears in this data set are females, and 69.2% are
        males. Since we're used to thinking about percentages, it's useful to
        think of relative frequencies in terms of their equivalent percentages
        to help us interpret relative frequencies, but be clear - relative
        frequencies are proportions, not percentages.</p>
      <h3>Summarizing numeric variables</h3>
      <p>When we want to summarize numeric variables, we need to address two
        additional issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What characteristic of the data do we want to measure?</li>
        <li>What is the shape of our distribution?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember this picture from the first day of class:</p>
      <p><img style="width: 770px; height: 243px;" alt="Human histogram" src="human_histo.png"></p>
      <p>This is a photograph of a "human histogram" that shows the <strong>distribution</strong>
        of a numeric variable, height. The term "distribution" refers to where
        along the number line data values fall, and histograms are an excellent
        way of assessing the distribution of numeric data. The sideline of this
        football field is the x-axis of the graph, which has signs indicating
        height to the nearest inch - the variable whose distribution you are
        interested in is placed on the x-axis of a histogram. Each student is
        standing behind the sign indicating his or her height, and the number of
        students behind each sign gives us the y-axis, which is the frequency of
        occurrence of heights in these one inch intervals. Men are wearing black
        shirts and women are wearing white shirts, but try to ignore this for
        the moment and treat the data as one big, overall data set.</p>
      <p> If you look at this distribution, you should notice a couple of
        things. First, some heights are more common than others, and the most
        common heights are in the middle of the distribution. This is an
        indication that there is <strong>central tendency</strong> for these
        heights. Second, not everyone has the same height. This is an indication
        that there is <strong>dispersion</strong> in the data. </p>
      <h4 class="part" id="central_tendency">Central tendency</h4>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The reason we use measures of central tendency is to characterize the <em>typical</em>
        data value from a data set. We will always want to report a measure of
        central tendency when we summarize a data set. We will learn about three
        measures of central tendency for now: <strong>mean</strong>, <strong>median</strong>,
        and <strong>mode</strong>.</p>
      <p>The most commonly used measure of central tendency is the average, or
        more correctly, the <strong>arithmetic mean</strong>, or just the mean.
        The mean for this set of heights is about 5' 8" overall across both
        sexes (men are in dark shirts, women in light shirts). </p>
      <p>The formula for the mean is:</p>

      <p> Taken together, this formula is saying: </p>
      <p><em>The arithmetic mean of variable x equals the sum of x data values
          from the first to the last, divided by the sample size.</em></p>
      <p>The <strong>median</strong> of a data set is the middle value. If we
        have data values 18, 19, 21, 22, 26 sorted in order from smallest to
        largest, the middle value is the third one, which is 21. If we had an
        even number of data values, like 18, 19, 21, 22, then there isn't a
        middle data value, and instead the median is between the two middle
        numbers; it's calculated the sum of the two middle numbers divided by 2,
        or (19+21)/2 = 20.</p>
      <p>The <strong>mode</strong> is the most common data value. If you are
        working with discrete numeric variables, counting up the number of times
        data values occur is a good way to find the mode. This doesn't work as
        well with continuous numbers, like heights, because there may not be any
        duplicates at all. Any duplicates that occur may be coincidences, and
        may not be good indications of a typical value. If we ask for the mode
        when we are using MINITAB, it will count duplicates, even if the data
        are continuous - we won't use MINITAB's reported modes when we work with
        continuous data.</p>
      <h4 class="part" id="dispersion">Dispersion</h4>
      <p>Measures of dispersion are essential parts of a description of data,
        because the <em>typical</em> value doesn't represent all of the data.
        If you look at the human histogram again, you'll see that although the
        mean might be a good choice for the typical value for the entire set of
        heights, most students are not 5' 8". If all we did to summarize the
        data was to report a mean, we would be giving the impression that 5' 8"
        is representative of the heights of all the students, but that's not
        really accurate. We also need a measure of how var from this central
        value students generally fall, and measures of dispersion do this for
        us.</p>
      <p>Dispersion around the typical value can be measured, using statistics
        like the <strong>standard deviation</strong>. The standard deviation is
        a measure of the average distance of data values from the mean - big
        standard deviations mean the data are highly variable around the mean,
        and small standard deviations mean the data are less variable. The
        standard deviation for the histogram of heights is about 3" - which
        means that on average students are 3" above or below the mean of 5' 8".</p>
      <p>The formula for standard deviation is this:</p>
      <img style="width: 127px; height: 90px;" alt="Standard deviation" src="stdev.gif"><br>
      <p>The standard symbol for standard deviation is a lower-case s. To
        calculate the standard deviation, we subtract the mean from each data
        value, square the difference, and sum the squared differences. We then
        divide by n-1, which is called the <strong>degrees of freedom</strong>,
        and take the square root of the quotient. Degrees of freedom are used in
        statistics to account for cases in which we need to use one statistic to
        calculate another - in this case, we need to use the mean to calculate
        the standard deviation. When this is the case, we tend to under-estimate
        the standard deviation if we just divide by n, and subtracting 1 from n
        corrects for the problem.</p>
      <p>Since the standard deviation is based on variability around the mean,
        it has a natural relationship with the mean - when we report a mean as
        our measure of central tendency, we usually report standard deviation as
        the measure of dispersion.</p>
      <p>The other measures of dispersion we will learn today are the <strong>variance</strong>
        and the <strong>interquartile range</strong>.</p>
      <p>The variance is just the standard deviation squared - think of it as
        the average squared difference between data values and their mean. It's
        not as easily interpreted as the standard deviation because it's not in
        the same units as the data. For example if we had measured heights in
        feet and we found the standard deviation was .5 feet, the variance would
        be 0.25 ft<sup>2</sup>. Variance gets used later in the semester when we
        start doing hypothesis testing, but we won't be using it yet. The
        standard symbol for variance is s<sup>2</sup>, and its formula is:</p>
      <img alt="Variance" src="var2.gif">
      <p>Notice that the sigma symbol doesn't have a from or to index listed -
        these are fairly commonly omitted when all of the data values are to be
        summed over, so when you don't see a "from" or "to" index assume that
        you are to sum over all the data.</p>
      <p>The interquartile range is the next measure of dispersion we'll learn
        about, which is based on percentiles rather than on variability around
        the mean. To understand the interquartile range, we will use this
        illustration of a set of 16 data values, sorted from smallest to
        largest: </p>
      <p><img src="interquartile_range.jpg" alt="quartiles" style="width: 643px; height: 135px;"></p>
      <p>As we already learned, the median is the middle data value, but since
        16 is an even number of data points the median is the midpoint between
        the 8th and 9th value, like the illustration above. The median divides
        the data set in half, so 50% of the data values fall below it, and 50%
        fall above it. Another name for the median is the 50th percentile,
        because it's the data value below which 50% of data points fall.</p>
      <p>We can extend this approach to find other percentiles besides the 50th
        - 1/4 of 16 is 4, so halfway between the 4th and 5th data values is the
        25th percentile, because 25% of the data fall below that value. Halfway
        between the 12th and 13th data values is the 75th percentile, because
        75% of data values fall below that point. Since the 25th, 50th, and 75th
        percentiles divide the data into quarters, we can also call them <strong>quartiles</strong>.

              <p>Let's see how this would work in practice. The table to the
                left has the same data as the illustration, but it's out of
                order. The "Rank order" column shows the data values numbered
                from smallest to largest. Click on the Rank order column heading
                to sort the data from smallest to largest.</p>
              <p>Now that the numbers are in order, you can use the rank
                ordering to identify the data values to use to calculate the
                median - the median is halfway between the 8th and 9th data
                values, and it's equal to (2.87+2.93/2) = 2.9</p>
              <p>The 25th percentile is between the 4th and 5th data values, and
                is equal to (2.31+2.37)/2 = 2.34</p>
              <p>The 75th percentile is between the 12th and 13th data values,
                and is equal to (3+3.09)/2 = 3.045</p>
              <p>It's important to remember that we only use the rank ordering
                to find the quartiles, but the quartiles are expressed as <em><strong>data
                    values</strong></em>, not as their ranks (for example, the
                median is between the 8th and 9th data values, but it's equal to
                the midpoint between the data values, 2.9, not the midpoint
                between the ranks, 8.5).</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Finally, now that we know what the quartiles are, we can calculate the
        interquartile range by subtracting the 25th percentile from the 75th
        percentile:&nbsp; 3.045 - 2.340 = 0.705.</p>
      <p>Just like the standard deviation is a natural pairing with the mean,
        the interquartile range is a natural pairing with the median, because
        interquartile ranges are based on quartiles, and the median is simply
        the second quartile.</p>
      <h4 class="part" id="skewness">Skewness</h4>
      <p>We can also characterize a third property of the data, called its <strong>

                though, and identify the direction of skew by which side of the

                in this one is pointed towards the positive side of the number
                line, so we call it <strong>positively skewed</strong>. Since,

      <p>The reason we care about skewness in the distribution of our data is
        that it makes a big difference in how we interpret the data. The
        animation below illustrates what happens to our three measures of
        central tendency (mean, median, and mode) as the distribution goes from
        right to left skewed. You'll see that when the distribution is
        symmetrical they are all the same, and we can't really make a bad choice
        of a measure to represent the typical value for our data set. But, in
        skewed distributions they are not all the same, and the choice matters
        more.</p>

              <p>If you play the animation you'll see that as a distribution
                goes from being right skewed to symmetrical to left skewed the
                relative positions of the mean and median change.</p>
              <p> Since we want our measure of central tendency to be an
                indicator of the typical data value, it looks like the median or
                mode are better choices than the mean as a measure of central
                tendency for skewed distributions.</p>
              <p>So, if the choice of measure of central tendency we use depends
                on the shape of the distribution, we need to be able to
                recognize skewed distributions when we see them so that we can
                choose the best measure for the data set.</p>

      <p>The month with the most sightings of bears is August (month 8), with a
        frequency of 34 (nearly 25% of the observations overall). The numbers
        drop off both earlier and later in the year around August, so this
        variable is fairly symmetrical.</p>
      <p>Continuous data will often not show repeat values the way that discrete
        numbers do, so to get an idea of which data values are common and which
        are rare with a continuous variable, it is necessary to break the number
        line into <strong>bins</strong>, and then count up data values that
        fall within the bins. If we plot the numeric variable on the x-axis, and
        plot the frequencies of data values falling in the bins on the y-axis,
        we can use the graph to diagnose the shape of the distribution. </p>

              <p>To the left is an example in which data on rainfall (on the
                x-axis) is being divided up into bins that are 10 mm wide. The
                data points falling in each bin are identified and counted, and
                then a bar is drawn to indicate the number of data points in the
                bin. This type of graph is called a histogram, and you can see
                it's very similar to the human histogram of heights we were
                looking at earlier. You can see that the distribution of this
                rainfall data is pretty bell-shaped - most of the rainfall
                measurements are around the mean of 100 mm, and rainfall numbers

      <p>For continuous variables, a useful method of assessing shapes of
        distributions numerically is the <strong>five number summary</strong>.
        The five number summary is made up of the minimum data value, the first
        quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum data value. As
        long as there is only one mode in the data, the relative spacing of
        these numbers indicates the direction of skew.</p>
      <p>For example, if you had a skewed distribution that looked like one of

      <p><br>
      </p>
      <img src="five_number.jpg" alt="Five number"><br>
      <p> You can see that in a left-skewed distribution the minimum is further
        from the median than the maximum is, and the first quartile is further
        from the median than the third quartile is. This arrangement is reversed
        for a right-skewed distribution - the minimum and first quartile are
        closer to the median than the maximum and third quartile are,
        respectively. By comparing the spacing of the values on either side of
        the median, you can see the direction of the skew.</p>

      <p>When the data are asymmetrical (skewed), then the median is a better
        choice, and should be paired with the interquartile range. Since the

        fall within 1, 2, or 3 SD of a mean, depending on whether the
        distribution is "bell-shaped" (like the normal distribution), or some
        other shape (like a flat line with no peak in the middle, or a bimodal

      <p>Remember our height data - the mean was 5' 8", and the standard
        deviation was 3". The histogram was roughly bell-shaped, so we would
        expect that 68% of heights would fall between 5' 8" - 3" = 5' 5" and 5'
        8" + 3" = 5' 11". We would expect 95% of heights to fall within 2
        standard deviations, or 6", of the mean, so between 5' 8" - 6" = 5' 2"
        and 5' 8" + 6" = 6' 2".</p>
      <h3>Dispersion affects interpretation of results</h3>
      <p>Let's look at another example. If a pharmaceutical salesperson told
        you: "Taking Pressurex reduces blood pressure on average by 10 mm Hg",
        should you be impressed? Does that mean that nearly everyone who takes
        the medication will have reduced blood pressure? Or do many people take
        the medicine and experience no change, or even have their blood pressure
        increase? The answer depends on the standard deviation.</p>
      <p>Let's assume the standard deviation of blood pressures is s = 10 mm.
        Since the improvement in blood pressure was 10 mm, patients that fall
        more than 1 s above the mean would have an improvement of 0, and would
        not benefit from the drug. How many people would fall 1 s or more above
        the mean?</p>
      <p>First, if you assume that blood pressures have a nice symmetrical,
        bell-shaped distribution, what percentage of people would have blood
        pressures above the mean?</p>
      <p><a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('pct_over_mean')">Click here to see
          if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="pct_over_mean" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> The mean is in the middle,
          and the curve is symmetrical, so 50% of the data should fall above the
          mean. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Next, we know from the table that 68% of people will be within 1 s of
        the mean (either above or below), so what percentage would be within 1 s
        above the mean?</p>
      <p> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('pct_1s_over_mean')">Click here to
          see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="pct_1s_over_mean" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Half of the 68% that fall
          within 1 s of the mean will fall above the mean, and the other half
          will be below the mean. So, half of 68%, or 34%, will be between the
          mean and 1 s above it.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So, if 50% of all people are above the mean, and 34% are between the
        mean and the mean plus 1s, what percentage have blood pressures even
        higher than 1 s above the mean?</p>
      <p><a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('pct_over_1s_over_mean')">Click here
          to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="pct_over_1s_over_mean" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> If 50% are above the mean,
          and 34% are within 1 s of the mean, then the rest are more than 1 s
          away from the mean, which is 50%-34% = 16%</p>
      </div>
      <p>So, based on these calculations, if the standard deviation in the
        reduction in BP is 10, then we would expect 16% of patients to either
        have no improvement, or to have an increase in BP instead of a decrease.</p>
      <p> What if instead the claimed 10 mm Hg average improvement was
        accompanied by a standard deviation of 3.33 mm Hg? </p>
      <table style="width: 100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><video style="float: left; padding: 10px" controls="controls" width="400"
                height="300"> <source src="sd_demo.mp4"> </video>
              <p>Let's look at this graphically - the animation on the left
                always uses 10 mm Hg as the mean improvement, and it starts with
                a standard deviation of 10 mm Hg. We already calculated that 16%
                of patients aren't helped by Pressurex, when zero improvement is
                1 standard deviation above the mean.</p>
              <p>As the animation progresses, the mean improvement stays the
                same but the standard deviation gets smaller until it's equal to
                3.33 mm Hg. An improvement of 10 mm Hg is now 10/3.33 = 3
                standard deviations away from 0, and as you can see this means
                that nearly everyone had their BP reduced on the drug.</p>
              <p>From the table, we can see that 99% of data values fall within
                3 s of the mean, so 1% of patients will be further away than 3 s
                from the mean. Half of that 1% that is more than 3 s away from
                the mean is above it, so only 0.5% would be expected to be
                higher than 0, where there was no improvement in BP.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">What should you
        learn from this? Since the mean is always the same throughout the
        animation, you should see that it's not enough to know the average
        amount of improvement, because the mean alone doesn't tell you how
        consistent the amount of reduction is. You also need to know the
        standard deviation to know whether that average reduction of 10 mm Hg is
        typical of what most of the patients experience, or whether the amount
        of reduction could be much greater or much less than the mean.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">In this week's
        activity we will learn to calculate and interpret summary statistics for
        variables, and to select appropriate summaries given the shape of the
        distribution of a numeric variable. </p>
