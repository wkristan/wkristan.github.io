      <p>When scientists seek to understand a system, their approach is to
        identify the <strong>components</strong> that make up the system,
        measure the <strong>properties</strong> of the components, and then
        measure the <strong>relationships</strong> between the components. </p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td> <img alt="Schematic diagram of digestion" src="schematic_digestion.png"
                style="float: left; padding: 10px">
              <p>The components of a system are anything that the scientist
                thinks might be important to the system's functioning. In the
                schematic illustration to the left of the human digestive system
                you can see there are several major components labeled. When a
                scientist begins to study a system that isn't yet understood, he
                or she may not know which components are important, and a simple
                schematic model like this one would represent a hypothesis about
                how the system functions. We actually understand digestion
                pretty well, enough to know that the diagram isn't complete,
                because it leaves out regulation by the brain, effects of
                hormones, influences from the environment, effects of intestinal
                parasites, or any other of the dozens of factors that have some
                effect on how digestion works in the body. However, the
                components that are most important for doing the work of
                breaking down food into its constituent chemicals and absorbing
                them into the blood stream are represented here.</p>
              <p>Once a scientist identifies the components to be studied, he or
                she has to measure their properties. We measure properties of
                components by defining <strong>variables</strong> that
                characterize them. We might use a variable called "salivary
                gland weight" to measure the size of the salivary gland, or
                "stomach volume" to measure how much space for food is in the
                stomach, or "pancreatic enzymes" to list the enzymes the
                pancreas secretes for digestion, or "passage time" to measure
                how long it takes for a meal to pass through the system and exit
                the body. More than one property for each component may be
                important, and we may need more than one variable - for example,
                the small intestine is where digested nutrients pass into the
                blood stream, so we may want to measure "small intestine length"
                as one property of the small intestine, and "small intestine
                surface area" as another property of the small intestine, both
                of which are possible ways that the body can influence how well
                food is absorbed.</p>
              <p>This may all seem natural, and a little obvious, based on your
                experiences in science lab classes you've taken. But, in your
                previous classes your instructors probably defined all the
                variables you used for you, and you may not have had to think
                much about how variables are defined, or even why it's important
                to do so. To understand why defining variables is important in
                scientific work, consider that the structured approach to
                studying nature is not the only way to proceed. </p>
              <p>For example, we could instead watch some people eating and
                record whatever we notice during our observations. As we observe
                different people, we may notice different things - maybe the
                first person is a fast chewer and the second person seems to
                chew more slowly, and a third barely chews at all. We may hear
                stomach noises after a meal for one and write that down. We may
                notice that one person is heavier than the others, and record
                that. While observing one person we may notice that materials
                that leave the body look (and smell) different from the
                materials that enter it. Once we have a large collection of
                observations, we could try to figure out what they tell us about
                how the body digests food.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>That is, we <em>could</em> proceed this way, but such a haphazard
        approach would make it extremely difficult to understand the system.
        Without a guiding hypothesis about what the important components are,
        and without a consistent set of measurements recorded on well-defined
        variables that represent their important properties, and without making
        the same measurements in the same way for each person, it would be
        difficult to even describe the consistent features of digestion, much
        less figure out how the system works. </p>
      <p>Making measurements of variables produces <strong>data</strong>. In
        everyday usage data is a general term that refers to any factual
        information that is recorded, even if it comes from a haphazard method
        of collecting information. When scientists talk about data, however,
        they are usually referring to measurements of carefully defined
        variables. Defining variables is an important part of the structured
        approach that scientists take to understanding the systems they study.</p>
      <h2>Defining variables - types and measurement scales</h2>
      <p>It's important to define variables correctly, because all of the
        choices we make in how we graph, summarize, and make sense of our data
        depend on the variable type. We can make a fundamental distinction
        between variables that are <span style="font-weight: bold;">numeric</span>
        or <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-numeric</span> (also called <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">categorical</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">attribute</span>
        variables). Numeric variables are made up of numbers, whereas
        non-numeric variables are made up of labels (such as tree species, sex,
        or color).<br>
      </p>
      <h3 id="numeric" class="part">Numeric variables<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Numeric variables are made up of numbers by definition, but we can make
        a distinction between numeric variables that can take any value on the
        number line (in which case the variable is <span style="font-weight: bold;">continuous</span>),
        or instead can only be a particular set of numeric values (in which case
        the numbers are <span style="font-weight: bold;">discrete</span>).
        Continuous variables can be expressed as decimals, or equivalently as
        ratios (e.g. 10.1 can be expressed as 10 1/10). The integers
        0,1,2,3,4... are a good example of discrete numbers that do not include
        decimal values. A common type of discrete variable in biology is a count
        (of cells on a slide, of species in a forest, etc.).</p>
      <p>Be careful in using the presence of decimals, by the way, to tell
        whether a variable is discrete or continuous. If we are counting the
        number of fertilized seeds we find in apples the possible numbers are 0,
        1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We could express these as proportions if we divide
        the number of apple seeds we find by 5, which is the largest number
        possible, which would give us 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. Even though
        these numbers have decimals there are still only five possible data
        values, so we would consider them to be discrete. To tell if a numeric
        variable is continuous or discrete, ask whether it's possible for the
        variable to take any value on the number line - if so, it's continuous,
        and if not it's discrete.</p>
      <p>We can further distinguish between different <strong>measurement
          scales</strong> for numeric variables that affect what kinds of
        mathematical operations we can and cannot apply.</p>
      <h4 class="part" id="numeric meas scales">Measurement scales for numeric
        variables</h4>
      <p>Some numeric variables are measured on a <strong>circular scale</strong>.
        Obvious examples of circular variables would be recordings of angles or
        directions, that are measured in degrees. However, any variable with
        values that repeat are circular variables, including time of day, and
        date (if we only consider the number of days since the first of the
        year, without the calendar year included). Since numbers repeat on a
        circular scale the starting point is arbitrary - 0 degrees is placed at
        the top of the compass in the illustration below, but it could be placed
        anywhere we want by rotating the compass. Numbers on a compass increase
        up to 360 degrees, at which point the numbers start again at 0 - 360
        degrees and 0 degrees are the same point on the compass.</p>

              <p><img style="padding: 10px; float: left;" alt="Pigeons" src="dsc_08451.jpg">Imagine
                that we conducted a simple orientation experiment on some homing
                pigeons, in which we moved two pigeons away from their roost and
                released them, and then recorded the direction they flew away. </p>
              <p>The thin black lines on the compass to the right represent one
                possible outcome, in which one pigeon flew at 80 degrees and the
                other flew at 100 degrees. The average of 80 and 100 is 90, and
                the thick black line pointing to 90 shows that the average
                direction is right between the two measured directions. So far
                nothing unusual.</p>
              <p>But, the pigeons could just as easily have flown at 10 degrees
                and 350 degrees, like the two thin blue lines. The middle of
                these thin blue lines is 0/360, so that is where the average
                angle should go. However, because 350 and 10 cross over the
                point at which the numbers on the scale repeat, taking an
                average of these two flight directions gives us 180, which is as
                wrong as it can possibly be.</p>
              <p>There are methods for calculating a mean angle that work
                correctly, but unfortunately they are beyond the scope of this
                class, and we won't spend time on them now. For now, what you
                should learn from this simple example is that it's important to
                know when your numeric variable is on a circular scale so that
                you don't apply an inappropriate mathematical operation to your
                data.</p>

      <p>The two measurement scales for continuous numbers that we <em>will</em>
        encounter throughout the semester are <i><b>ratio scale</b></i> and <i><b>interval
            scale</b></i>. In contrast to circular scale variables, both ratio
        and interval scales are linear, which means that possible values fall
        between negative infinity to positive infinity without repeating. The
        easiest way to understand the difference between ratio and interval
        scale variables is to think about what a measurement of 0 means on each
        scale. </p>

              <p><strong>Ratio scale</strong> variables have a true zero, in the
                sense that 0 indicates a lack of the quantity. Most measured
                dimensions, like these cell diameters, are ratio scale because a
                diameter of zero means "no diameter". Because the zero is
                meaningful, it's valid to say that a 100 Î¼m pollen grain is 10
                times as big as a 10 Î¼m red blood cell&nbsp; - that is, ratios
                of numbers on a ratio scale are meaningful.</p>
              <p>We deal with lots of measurements of physical dimensions and
                quantities in Biology, and such measurements will almost always

                encounter in this class are ratio scale.</p>

              <p><strong>Interval scale</strong> variables do not have a true
                zero, in that 0 does not indicate a lack of a quantity.
                Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius are good examples of
                interval scale variables, because 0 degrees F or C does not mean
                "no temperature". Since the 0 isn't meaningful, it isn't correct
                to say that the boiling point of water is 6.625 times hotter
                than the freezing point of water (212/32 = 6.625). If we did the
                same calculation with the equivalent temperatures in degrees C
                we would get 100/0, which is different from the calculation in
                degrees F (division by 0 is undefined).</p>
              <p>You will encounter fewer variables in Biology on an interval
                scale, but the few that we do use (like temperature) are used

      <h3 class="part" id="cat">Categorical (non-numeric) variables</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Non-numeric variables are made up of named categories, called <strong>levels</strong>.
        Examples of non-numeric variables are color (made up of the levels blue,
        green, red, etc.), state (made up of the levels California, Oregon, New
        Hampshire, etc.), and name (made up of the levels Bob, Carol, Ted,
        Alice, etc.).</p>
      <h4 class="part" id="cat meas scales">Measurement scales for categorical
        variables<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Non-numeric variables also have measurement scales, but they are
        different from numeric scales. Categorical variables that have levels
        with no natural ordering are called <strong>nominal scale</strong>
        variables. Since colors, state names, and names of people are just
        labels, with no natural ordering to them, they are all nominal scale
        categorical variables.</p>
      <p>However, some categorical variables do have a natural order, even
        though they are not numbers - for example, if we have a categorical
        variable "health status" made up of the categories "healthy", "sick",
        and "dead", there is a clear natural ordering from best to worst of
        healthy, sick, dead. Categorical variables with levels that have a
        natural ordering are called <b>ordinal scale</b> variables. The amount
        of difference between the levels of an ordinal scale variable are not
        defined - how much better it is to be healthy than sick, and whether the
        difference between healthy and sick is the same as between sick and dead
        isn't clear, even though the ordering is. Many mathematical operations
        can't be done on ordinal categorical variables, but we can take the
        ordering into account when we graph data, and in some types of data
        analysis that we will encounter later in the semester.</p>

        your answers:</p>
      <p><em>Student name</em> - what is the variable type, and what is the
        measurement scale? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('studname')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="studname" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Names are clearly not
          numbers, so this is categorical. The levels that make up the variable
          are the names of the students, that have no natural order; the
          measurement scale is nominal. </p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Height in inches</em> - what is the variable type, and what is the
        measurement scale? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('height')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="height" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Height is numeric, and
          since heights can have decimals it is continuous numeric - don't be
          fooled that the heights are only measured to the nearest inch -
          decimal values are possible. Since there is a meaningful zero (zero
          height means "no height") height is measured on a ratio scale. </p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Number of Facebook friends</em> - what is the variable type, and
        what is the measurement scale? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('fbfriends')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="fbfriends" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Number of Facebook friends
          is numeric. The numbers are counts, and counts come in whole numbers,
          without decimals - so this is a discrete numeric variable. The zero is
          meaningful (0 means "no friends") so the measurement scale is ratio. </p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Internet usage</em> - there are two different versions of this
        variable in the table, one that uses categories, and one that gives
        numeric codes for the categories. What are the variable types, and what
        are the measurement scales? Does converting the category names to
        numeric codes change the variable type? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('netuse')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="netuse" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> The text categories give
          this away for the first version of the variable - it's categorical.
          Since the categories have a natural order (Light &lt; Moderate &lt;
          Heavy) it's an ordinal categorical variable. Using numeric codes
          doesn't change the variable type - assigning a 3 to heavy and a 1 to
          light doesn't mean the difference between them is 2 (we could just as
          easily have assigned them the codes 1100 and 1300, but that wouldn't
          change how different heavy and light usage are). So, both versions of
          the variable are ordinal categorical. </p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Sex</em> - what is the variable type, and what is the measurement
        scale? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('sex')">Click here to see if
          you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="sex" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Sex is categorical. The
          sexes don't have a natural order, so it's recorded on a nominal scale.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p><em>Bed time</em> - what is the variable type, and what is the
        measurement scale? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('wake')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="wake" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Time is a circular scale.
          It can be measured to fractional seconds, so it is continuous, but the
          numbers repeat daily, which makes it circular. </p>

      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="MINITAB worksheet" src="minitab_worksheet.png" style="float: left; padding: 10px;">
              <p>We will be using MINITAB as the data analysis software for this
                class, and MINITAB organizes data in tables it calls <strong>worksheets</strong>
                that are organized as a grid of rows and columns of <strong>cells</strong>.
                Data are entered in cells, like the illustration to the left,
                and the first row of cells is labeled with a row number 1. Above
                the first row of cells is a row for column labels which are used
                to identify the data in the column ("ColumnHeading" and
                "NumericColumn" are column labels). The column numbers are above
                the column labels, and are shown as C1, C2, and so on.</p>
              <p>You may have worked with worksheets in Excel before, and
                although they look very similar, MINITAB's worksheets are less
                flexible than Excel's. In MINITAB each column must contain a
                single variable, and the columns are assigned a variable type.
                MINITAB only has two variable types that it recognizes, either
                numeric or "text" (i.e. categorical), and it decides which
                variable type the column is when you enter the first data value.
                The "T" after "C1" indicates that C1 is a text column. Now that
                C1's type is set to "text", even if you entered numbers in C1's
                cells MINITAB would treat the numbers as categorical values.
                Likewise, column C2 is a numeric column, and attempting to enter
                anything other than numbers will produce an error message.</p>
              <p>So, MINITAB does recognize different variable types, but only
                distinguishes between numeric and non-numeric (text) variables.
                It's up to you to know what kind of numeric or text variable
                you're working with, and to know the measurement scale of the
                variable, because MINITAB doesn't make this distinction for you
                and will happily apply the wrong analysis to your data if you
                ask it to.</p>

      <p>Even with MINITAB's inflexibility about data types, there are still
        some choices to be made about how to organize your data. MINITAB allows
        us to use either a <strong>stacked</strong> or an <strong>unstacked</strong>
        organization for our worksheets. </p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">

            <td> <img src="data_organization.jpg" style="width: 345px; height: 397px; float: left; padding: 10px; padding-right: 20px;"
                alt="Data organization">
              <p><strong>Stacked</strong> data uses one row in the worksheet for
                each observation, and each column represents a variable recorded
                for that observation. In the example to the left you can see the
                first 13 rows from 30 total with some data on masses of guppies
                recorded from pools in Trinidad. Everything recorded about a
                single pool is entered in a single row. For each pool we have
                data on average masses of guppies (in column Guppy mass),
                whether the pool had predators present or not (as indicated by
                the Predator column - the "Present" rows are all off the
                screen), and the size class of the pools (as indicated by Pool
                size).</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p> Stacked data organization has many <em>advantages</em>: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is easy to analyze. Data analysis software (MINITAB, Excel, R)
          can easily use the levels of a categorical variable to group data for
          analysis. For example, we could easily calculate averages of guppy
          masses grouped by predator status, by pool size, or by the combination
          of the two. We can also easily count up how many pools had each level
          of Predator, each level of Pool Size, or combinations of the two as
          well. </li>
        <li>It is self-explanatory. Because each column is a variable, we can
          use the column labels to identify what each variable is. Since the
          rows correspond with measurements from a single pool, we know that all
          the data in row 1 pertains to one pool, all the data in row 2 pertains
          to another pool, and so on.</li>
        <li>It is easy to extend. If we collect additional data about the pools
          (such as the temperature of the water, or the surface area of the
          pool), we can add it to the data set by simply adding more columns. If
          we measure more pools we can just tack on some additional rows of
          data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The only real disadvantage of stacked data is that it isn't very space
        efficient, because the same pieces of information have to be entered
        multiple times - for example, we have to enter the word "Absent" 15
        times and "Present" 15 times, once for each pool. With 30 pools measured
        on three variables it takes 30 x 3 = 90 cells to record all of guppy
        masses, predator information, and pool size information. </p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 623px; height: 169px; float: left; padding: 10px;"
                alt="Unstacked data" src="unstacked.jpeg">
              <p>The other way that MINITAB allows us to organize our data is an
                <strong>un-stacked</strong> arrangement, which is shown to the
                left. This is the same data set as in the stacked example, it is
                just organized differently.</p>
              <p>With un-stacked data only the average masses are recorded in
                the cells of the worksheet. Each column label identifies the
                combination of predator status and pool size for the guppy
                masses in that column.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The un-stacked approach is more compact than the stacked data approach
        - it only took 30 cells to record the 30 guppy masses using an
        un-stacked organization, compared with the 90 cells we needed for a
        stacked arrangement. With only 1/3 as many cells, the data file would be
        smaller for an un-stacked data set than for a stacked version of the
        same data.</p>
      <p>However, un-stacked data's file size advantage is overshadowed by some
        serious <em>disadvantages</em>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Un-stacked data is less self-explanatory. We are using combinations
          of predator status and pool size as column labels, but the columns are
          labeled using <em>levels</em> of two different categorical variables,
          and the variable <em>names</em> don't appear at all. The variable
          name "guppy mass" also doesn't appear in the data set, so it isn't
          obvious what the numbers in the cells are. We could use file <strong>metadata</strong>,
          which is data attached to a digital file that describes what the file
          contains, to explain what the numbers in each column are, but it's
          more obvious and self-documenting when we can use column names that
          identify the variables directly.</li>
        <li>It's not as easy to analyze. MINITAB figures out groupings to use to
          analyze data by looking at the levels in categorical variables in the
          data set, but there aren't any categorical variable columns in this
          un-stacked data set. If you wanted to average guppy mass by pool size
          (ignoring predators) MINITAB isn't able to tell that Absent-Large and
          Present-Large are both Large pools, that Absent-Medium and
          Present-Medium are both Medium pools, and that Absent-Small and
          Present-Small are both Small pools, because MINITAB doesn't understand
          grouping variables that are embedded into column headings.</li>
        <li>Rows don't mean anything. In un-stacked data, a row in the table is
          no longer a single pool, so there is no particular meaning to the fact
          that data values occupy the same row - that is, the 10.79 mass for the
          first row of Absent-Large isn't actually matched in any way with the
          9.49 mass for Absent-Medium. </li>
        <li>It's difficult to add variables to the data set. Since rows no
          longer correspond with pools, if we wanted to add additional variables
          about the pools to the data set we can't just add on additional
          columns to hold the new variables.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In general, stacked data is the better data organization for raw,
        un-summarized data, even though it requires some more data entry work
        and creates larger files. Given all its advantages, stacked data will be
        used for essentially all the data sets you encounter in class, and you
        will use this approach with the data you collect for your class project.</p>
