    <h1>Metapopulations</h1>
    <p><img src="sdut-kearny-mesa-is-among-the-places-20160830.jpg" alt="Vernal pools"
        style="float:left; width:20%; margin-right: 10px"><img src="urban.gif" alt="Urban fragmentation"
        style="float:right; margin-left: 10px">Many landscapes are naturally
      patchy, like the vernal pools that appear during the winter and spring in
      San Diego, pictured on the left. These pools disappear during the dry
      season, and the aquatic plants and animals that live in them have
      adaptations that help them cope with the dry period. Aquatic animals
      cannot simply cross over dry land, and movement between the pools will be
      less common than movement within.</p>
    <p> Other habitats become patchy because of habitat fragmentation, like the
      urbanizing landscape of San Marcos and Escondido shown to the right. The
      image to the right shows an aerial view of the area around CSUSM, and
      polygons identifying some of the fragments of chaparral vegetation that
      are left after our region built up fade in and out. Prior to development
      the entire image would have been covered by chaparral, so the chaparral
      plants and animals in these fragments would have lived in a contiguous sea
      of suitable habitat before development. Movement between the patches may
      still be possible, particularly for more mobile species, but some species
      will not be able to move easily from place to place.</p>
    <p> Regardless of the cause of patchiness, simple population models aren't
      designed to account for how a population that is subdivided into patches
      of habitat, linked by movements but subject to local extinctions, would
      change over time. The fact that the sub-populations are prone to going
      extinct would suggest that fragmentation could be a risk factor for
      extinction of the entire population - after all, as extinctions accumulate
      eventually all of the patches could be lost. However, it is also possible
      for a patch that experiences a local extinction could be re-colonized from
      another occupied patch. This <strong>rescue effect</strong> would be a
      novel feature of fragmented populations. </p>
    <h2>A model of metapopulation dynamics</h2>
    <p>Populations made up of sub-populations linked by movements of individual
      organisms are called <strong>metapopulations</strong>. From a
      conservation perspective, local extinction of the sub-population is not
      necessarily a problem, provided that the metapopulation as a whole is
      persistent.</p>
    <p>Metapopulations are a good example of how mathematics helped us
      understand an ecological system better. Simple models can help us
      understand some of the key features of how a system works without all of
      the complexity of the real world. For example, we can start by supposing
      that we have a collection of patches of habitat that are separated by
      non-habitat of some kind - could be islands surrounded by ocean, or
      patches of forest surrounded by clearcuts, or high elevation rocky
      outcrops surrounded by low elevation forest. Our model will be of a single
      species, but to keep our model simple we will only model the proportion of
      patches that are occupied by our species - we will call the proportion
      occupied <strong>p</strong> (we won't worry about whether the population
      occupying a patch has a single individual or a population of thousands).</p>
    <p>We can continue our approach to understanding change over time (or <strong>dynamics</strong>)
      as being a simple balance between additions and subtractions. The
      proportion of patches occupied should be a balance between patches that
      are currently occupied but experience a local extinction (the
      subtractions) and patches that are not currently occupied but that are
      colonized by movement from one of the occupied patches (the additions).</p>
    <p>A patch can only become unoccupied patch if it starts off occupied. We
      will calculate the expected rate that populations will go extinct using
      some basic probability theory. Our proportion of sub-populations occupied,
      p, can be interpreted as a probability, because the probability of
      randomly selecting a patch that is occupied is equal to the proportion
      occupied, p. We can define a second probability, e, which is the
      probability that an occupied patch goes extinct at an instant in time. If
      e is the probability of an extinction of an occupied patch, then the
      proportion of occupied patches that are expected to go extinct in an
      instant in time is <strong>ep</strong>.</p>
    <p>Movement between patches can also be represented as a probability, <strong>m</strong>,
      which is the probability that an individual will move from an occupied
      patch to another patch (either occupied or not) in an instant of time. We
      won't worry about how many individuals move from one patch to the next -
      think of m as being movement of sufficient numbers to start a new
      population in an unoccupied patch, whatever that number happens to be.
      However, a movement between an occupied patch and another occupied patch
      doesn't change the total number of patches occupied. For a movement to
      increase the number of patches occupied we need for the movement to be
      from an occupied patch to an unoccupied patch. Movement from an occupied
      patch would just be <strong>mp</strong> - the probability that a patch is
      occupied and has a movement from it. Since there are only two possible
      states for a patch, occupied or unoccupied, we know that if the proportion
      of patches occupied is p then the proportion that is unoccupied has to be
      <strong>1-p</strong>. The proportion of unoccupied patches that will be
      re-colonized by a movement is thus <strong>mp(1-p)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Putting these two sources of change over time together, we get our simple
      metapopulation model:</p>
    <img src="metapop_diffeq.png" alt="Diff eq">
    <p>The left side is read as "Change in p over change in time" - the d's
      indicate change - and according to this model we expect that change in the
      proportion of sites occupied will equal colonization (mp(1-p)) minus
      extinction (ep). This is the first metapopulation model developed, by a
      mathematical biologogist named Richard Levins in 1969, and as the first it
      is also the simplest.</p>
    <p>Since we expect that sub-populations will be lost (at a rate of e), we
      should be concerned that loss of sub-populations will eventually lead to
      loss of the entire metapopulation - the metapopulation as a whole is
      extinct if p is equal to 0. The question is, does this model tell us that
      it's possible for a metapopulation as a whole to be stable, or does it
      predict that metapopulations will always decline to extinction?</p>
    <p> We can answer this question by finding the equilibrium solution. When
      the amount of change over time is 0 we consider the model to be at an
      equilibrium, in that it isn't going to increase or decrease any further
      without some outside force changing it. We find the equilibrium for a
      model like this by setting the change in p over time (dp/dt) to 0 and then
      solving for p. Doing so gives us:</p>
    <img src="metapop_equilibrium.png" alt="Equilibrium">
    <p></p>
    <p>The "hat" over the p indicates that this is an equilibrium solution.</p>
    <p>So, based on this equilibrium solution is a metapopulation stable? The
      answer is, it depends. You should be able to see a couple of things by
      looking at the structure of this equation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If extinction rate and movement rate are equal the equilibrium
        proportion of patches occupied is 0 - the equilibrium patches occupied
        of 0 means the metapopulation is expected to go extinct if e = m. This
        will be true no matter what the values of e and m are (the
        metapopulation could have a very low extinction rate and a very low
        movement rate, or it could have a high extinction rate with a high
        movement, and it will still go extinct - it will just take longer in the
        first case than in the second case).</li>
      <li>If extinction rate is greater than movement rate then e/m is greater
        than 1, and subtracting a value greater than 1 from 1 gives a negative
        number. Even though pÌ‚ is a proportion and can't possibly be negative
        you can interpret this value as indicating that the metapopulation is
        not stable, and is expected to go extinct.</li>
      <li>If extinction rate is less than movement rate then e/m will less than
        1, and the equilibrium proportion of patches occupied will be greater
        than 0 - the metapopulation should be stable over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that what we mean by the metapopulation being stable over time is
      that it would not tend to go extinct overall. However, the fact that any
      given patch has a probability, e, of extinction means that we can expect a
      different set of patches to be occupied at any given time. In other words,
      we would expect a lot of unpredictable, random chance in which patches we
      will actually find the species present at any given time, but extinctions
      would be balanced by colonizations, and the metapopulation as a whole
      should persist.</p>
    <h2>A metapopulation simulation app</h2>
    <p>Nice analytical models like the Levins model above have the advantage
      that you can use the structure of the equations to interpret what the
      model has to tell us about metapopulation dynamics, and you would have
      confidence that your interpretations are mathematically correct. However,
      to give you an idea of what the metapopulation model is actually saying is
      happening in the world, it is helpful to build a simulation.</p>
    <img src="data_source_bighorn.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 25%"><img
      src="BighornSheep_ownby1.jpg" style="float:right; width: 10%; margin-left: 10px">
    <p>The image to the left shows the data source we will use as the basis for
      a metapopulation simulation model - this is a map of the distribution of
      bighorn sheep in Colorado (the green outline is the Colorado border, which
      can easily be mistaken for a shoe box), and a picture of a bighorn sheep
      is on the right.</p>
    <p>Each of the red polygons is a patch of habitat where the sheep are found.
      Bighorn sheep prefer high-elevation, rocky habitat, and you can see that
      in this mountainous state their habitat is quite patchy. Each patch is
      potentially connected via movements by sheep between the patches, and each
      patch is subject to loss of its sheep population.</p>
    <p>Just like we learned when we worked with population viability models, an
      analytical model can have terms in it that are actually <strong>expected
        values</strong> of a random variable. Although the equilibrium solution
      tells us to expect a stable metapopulation any time m is greater than e,
      both of these terms are probabilities, and we can expect in reality the
      number of movements and number of extinctions will randomly vary from one
      year to the next. The equilibrium patch occupancy will thus be subject to
      random variation.</p>
    <p>This matters, because according to the Levins model if the extinction
      probability is only slightly lower than movement rate (i.e. with e = 0.49
      and m = 0.5) then the metapopulation is expected to be stable (i.e. 1 -
      0.49/0.5 = 0.02). With so few patches occupied it wouldn't take much
      random variation around this statistical expectation for those last
      patches to go extinct by chance, and the metapopulation could still be
      lost in spite of the non-zero pÌ‚.</p>
    <p>Below is an app that includes all but the smallest of the patches in the
      actual map (there are 41 patches used by the app, but 56 in the image
      above, some of which were very small and difficult to see).</p>
    <div style="width: 804; float:left; display: inline-block; clear:both; margin-right: 20px">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When you start the map is initialized with approximately 1/2 of the
      patches occupied. The movement rate is set to 0.5, meaning that the
      probability of a movement from one patch to another (occupied or not) is
      0.5. The extinction rate is set to 0.1, meaning that the probability of
      extinction from an occupied patch is 0.1. When you hit "Run again" you
      will see that the polygons change color - white indicates an unoccupied
      patch, and red indicate an occupied patch, and each time you run occupancy
      has the opportunity to change for each patch.</p>
    <p>Below the app you will see some numeric results. The proportion occupied
      (p) is given, as well as the number of colonizations (i.e. the number of
      unoccupied patches that received a movement from an occupied patch) and
      the number of extinctions (i.e. the number of occupied patches that lost
      their populations and became unoccupied).</p>
    <p>To understand what the model tells us about metapopulations, do the
      following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click "Run again" multiple times until the proportion occupied more or
        less stabilizes (10 or more should do it). What is the typical
        proportion occupied when m is 0.51 and e is 0.1, according to the model?</li>
      <li>If these sheep could fly they may not be bothered by the gaps between
        the patches, and movements might be really common. Furthermore, the
        habitat might be really good, and population sizes might be nice and
        high, such that extinctions are really rare. To simulate this, set
        movement to 0.95 and extinction to 0.01. What happens to the proportion
        occupied?</li>
      <li>If you set movement rate to 0.1 while leaving extinction at 0.01 you
        can still expect a high level of patch occupancy (the Levins model
        predicts 1-(0.01/0.1) = 0.9, or 90% occupancy), but when a patch loses
        its population the low movement rate will mean it stays unoccupied for
        longer. Set movement to 0.1 while extinction is 0.01 and you'll see that
        the white patches that occasionally pop up stay white for many clicks.</li>
      <li>The Levins model predicts that the metapopulation model is unstable if
        e = m, even if they are very small numbers. With the map showing all or
        nearly all of the patches occupied after the previous run, set movement
        to 0.01 and extinction to 0.01. Run multiple times. What happens to the
        proportion occupied? If it's going down (as we expect), is it changing
        quickly?</li>
      <li>Set the movement to 0.95 and get those patches occupied again. Then,
        set the extinction rate to 0.95 as well, and run repeatedly. Did the
        metapopulation go extinct? Was it faster or slower than the previous
        run, with e and m set to 0.01? You can hit "Reset" to get your
        metapopulation back.</li>
      <li>Let's see what it takes to make a stable metapopulation. We would
        expect that any values of m greater than e would do it, so let's try
        setting m to 0.6 and e to 0.5. Did the metapopulation go extinct?</li>
      <li>We can crank up the movements to higher values - try 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9
        and see at what point the metapopulation stops rapidly going extinct.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that it takes a higher movement rate than the Levins model
      predicts to prevent extinction when we let random variation come into
      play. Notice also that a stable metapopulation does not necessarily have
      all of its patches occupied, or even a majority of them if extinction
      rates are high. Because of this we have to be careful about using the
      absence of a species to indicate that habitat is not suitable for it - it
      could be that the habitat is perfectly fine, but that the population has
      recently gone locally extinct and hasn't yet been re-colonized.</p>
    <h2>Limitations of the simple models</h2>
    <p>Simple models like these can give us insight into how a patchy population
      is expected to change over time, but we need to be careful about expecting
      the simple Levins model (or my simple-minded simulation app based on it)
      to predict how an actual population will behave. Consider some of the
      sources of un-reality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some patches are quite large, and others are much smaller, yet a
        single extinction rate is used for all of them. If all the patches are
        suitable habitat we should expect the bigger patches to support bigger
        populations that are less likely to go extinct, and a single value of e
        doesn't reflect this.</li>
      <li>Some patches are close together and some are far apart. It is
        reasonable to expect that patches that are close together are more
        likely to have movements between them than ones that are far apart, yet
        we have a single movement probability that we use for every movement.</li>
      <li>Movements between patches will probably also be affected by the
        presence or absence of routes that are easy to move through. Since we
        are treating the "matrix" between the patches as gray, featureless space
        it isn't clear that this would matter, but if you look at the picture
        above you'll see that the patches cover most of the Rocky Mountains of
        Colorado. Some routes through mountains are much easier than others.</li>
      <li>Extinction rates are the same at all times for every patch. A
        colonization would be expected to involve just a few individuals, and
        for awhile the population size would be small. While the population is
        small it would be more prone to extinction, but would become less likely
        to go extinct if it persists long enough to grow to a more stable
        population size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, if the models are so unrealistic, why study them? The basic lessons
      of the Levins model hold up when you add more complexity. It is still the
      case that when movements balance extinctions a metapopulation can be
      stable. Adding more realism to the model makes it a better predictor of
      how a particular species will change over time, and if we were doing this
      exercise in support of a conservation plan for bighorn sheep we would want
      to use a more realistic version. But, to just explore the behavior of
      metapopulations, with a minimum of complexity to confuse and confound us,
      the simple Levins models is still perfectly suitable.</p>
