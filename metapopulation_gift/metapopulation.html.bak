    <h1>Metapopulations</h1>
    <p><img src="sdut-kearny-mesa-is-among-the-places-20160830.jpg" alt="Vernal pools"
        style="float:left; width:20%; margin-right: 10px"><img src="urban.gif" alt="Urban fragmentation"
        style="float:right; margin-left: 10px">Many landscapes are naturally
      patchy, like the vernal pools pictured on the left that appear during the
      winter and spring in San Diego. These pools disappear during the dry
      season, and the aquatic plants and animals that live in them are adapted
      to coping with the short period of time in which they are able to complete
      their life cycle, and to living through the dry period when there is no
      standing water. Most aquatic plants and animals cannot simply cross over
      dry land, and movement between the pools will be relatively uncommon. If a
      pool loses its population of an organism, like this <span class="tooltip">
        fairy shrimp<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="chirocephalus-diaphanus.jpg"></span></span>,
      it might take some time for colonists from another pool to find a way back
      to the still suitable, but unoccupied, habitat there. </p>
    <p> Other landscapes become patchy because of habitat fragmentation, like
      the urbanizing landscape of San Marcos shown to the right. This aerial
      image shows the area around CSUSM, and the blue polygons fading in and out
      help you see some of the fragments of chaparral vegetation that remain
      after our region built up. Prior to development the entire image would
      have been covered by chaparral, so in the absence of development the
      plants and animals in these fragments would have lived in a contiguous sea
      of suitable habitat. Movement between the patches may still be possible
      now, particularly for more mobile species, but many species will not be
      able to move easily from place to place. A patch of habitat that loses one
      of its species, such as <span class="tooltip"> this roadrunner<span class="tooltiptext"><img
            src="roadrunner.png"></span></span> (yes, they are real birds), may
      be unoccupied by the species for some time before individuals from another
      patch are able to find their way.</p>
    <p> Regardless of the cause of patchiness, simple population models aren't
      designed to account for a population that is subdivided into patches. If
      the patches are linked by movement of individuals, then they aren't
      completely independent populations. But, if movement is impeded to some
      extent by the non-habitat between the patches of habitat then we can't
      expect the collection of patches to act exactly as a single, large
      population would. Any single patch of habitat will have a small population
      in it (at least, a population than is smaller than the total number of
      individuals across all the patches), and will thus be more prone to
      extinction than if all the individuals in all the patches were part of one
      big, contiguous population. The fact that the sub-populations are prone to
      going extinct would suggest that fragmentation could be a risk factor for
      extinction of the entire population - after all, as extinctions accumulate
      eventually the last remaining patch would be lost, and the population
      would be extinct. However, it is also possible for a patch that
      experiences a local extinction to be re-colonized from another occupied
      patch. If we just treated each individual fragment as a separate, small
      population we would miss this <strong>rescue effect</strong>, and would
      think the situation is more dire than it actually is. Clearly, we need to
      think differently about patchy populations, and a good first step is to
      adopt a different model.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>A model of metapopulation dynamics</h2>
    <p>Populations made up of sub-populations linked by movements of individual
      organisms are called <strong>metapopulations</strong>. From a
      conservation perspective, local extinction of the sub-population is not
      necessarily a problem, provided that the metapopulation as a whole is
      persistent.</p>
    <p>Metapopulations are a good example of how mathematics helped us
      understand an ecological system better. Simple models can help us
      understand some of the key features of how a system works without all of
      the complexity of the real world to confuse and distract us. </p>
    <p>For example, we can start by supposing that we have a collection of
      patches of habitat that are separated by non-habitat of some kind - could
      be pools surrounded by dry land, or patches of chaparral surrounded by
      housing developments and universities, or high elevation rocky outcrops
      surrounded by low elevation forest. To keep our model simple we will only
      concern ourselves with the proportion of patches that are occupied - we
      will call the proportion occupied <strong>p</strong>. We won't worry
      about whether the population occupying a patch has a single individual or
      a population of thousands, if there is at least one individual in the
      patch it is occupied.</p>
    <p>We would like to know how p should be expected to change over time - that
      is, we want to understand the <strong>dynamics</strong> of the
      metapopulation. At its simplest, dynamics will just be a balance between
      gains and losses. For our proportion of patches occupied, p, we gain
      occupied patches when an unoccupied patch is colonized, and we lose an
      occupied patch when the individuals in it die out. For convenience, we
      will call the individuals in each of the patches <strong>sub-populations</strong>,
      so when an unoccupied patch is colonized it gains a sub-population, and
      when a patch loses its individuals then its sub-population experiences a <strong>local
        extinction</strong>.</p>
    <p>How many local extinctions of sub-populations should we expect to happen
      at any given time? A local extinction can only happen from an occupied
      patch, and the proportion of patches occupied is p. We can define a second
      value, e, which is the probability that an occupied patch will go extinct
      at any given time. If e is the probability of an extinction of an occupied
      patch, then the proportion of occupied patches that are expected to go
      extinct in an instant in time is <strong>ep</strong>. Thus, ep is the
      expected loss of occupied patches - the subtractions.</p>
    <p>What about colonizations? An unoccupied patch is colonized when
      individuals from an occupied patch move into it. Movement between patches
      can also be represented as a probability, <strong>m</strong>, which is
      the probability that an individual will move from an occupied patch to
      another patch (either occupied or not) at any given time. Movement can
      only happen from an occupied patch, so the proportion of occupied patches
      that have individuals moving out of them is <strong>mp</strong>. For a
      movement to increase the number of patches occupied we need for the
      movement to be from an occupied patch to an unoccupied patch. But, some of
      these movements are from occupied patches to occupied patches, and those
      do not increase the proportion of patches occupied. Since we are
      interested in how p might increase we only are interested in movements
      into unoccupied patches. Since there are only two possible states for a
      patch, occupied or unoccupied, we know that if the proportion of patches
      occupied is p then the proportion that is unoccupied has to be <strong>1-p</strong>.
      The proportion of unoccupied patches that will be re-colonized by a
      movement is thus <strong>mp(1-p)</strong>. These are the colonizations,
      which are gains in occupied patches - the additions.</p>
    <p>Putting these two sources of change over time together, we get our simple
      metapopulation model:</p>
    <img src="metapop_diffeq.png" alt="Diff eq">
    <p>The left side is read as "Change in p over change in time" - the d's
      indicate change - and according to this model we expect that change in the
      proportion of sites occupied will equal colonization (mp(1-p)) minus
      extinction (ep). This is the first metapopulation model developed, by a
      mathematical biologist named Richard Levins in 1969.</p>
    <p>Since we expect that sub-populations will be lost, we should be concerned
      that loss of sub-populations will eventually lead to loss of the entire
      metapopulation - the metapopulation as a whole is extinct if p is equal to
      0. The question is, does this model tell us that it's possible for a
      metapopulation as a whole to be stable, or does it predict that
      metapopulations will always decline to extinction?</p>
    <p> We can answer this question by finding the equilibrium solution. When
      the amount of change in p over time is 0 we consider the model to be at an
      equilibrium - it is expected neither to increase or decrease any further
      without some outside force changing it. We find the equilibrium for a
      model like this by setting the change in p over time (dp/dt) to 0 and then
      solving for p. Doing so gives us:</p>
    <img src="metapop_equilibrium.png" alt="Equilibrium">
    <p></p>
    <p>The "hat" over the p indicates that this is an equilibrium solution.</p>
    <p>So, based on this equilibrium solution is a metapopulation stable? The
      answer is, it depends. You should be able to see a couple of things just
      by looking at the structure of this equation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If extinction rate and movement rate are equal the equilibrium
          proportion of patches occupied is 0</strong> - the equilibrium patches
        occupied of 0 means the metapopulation is expected to go extinct if e =
        m. This will be true no matter what the values of e and m are (the
        metapopulation could have a very low extinction rate and a very low
        movement rate, or it could have a high extinction rate with a high
        movement, and it will still go extinct - it will just take longer in the
        first case than in the second case).</li>
      <li><strong>If extinction rate is greater than movement rate then
          metapopulation should go extinct</strong> - if e is greater than m
        then e/m is greater than 1, and subtracting a value greater than 1 from
        1 gives a negative number. Even though p̂ is a proportion and can't
        possibly be negative you can interpret this value as indicating that the
        metapopulation is not stable, and is expected to go extinct.</li>
      <li><strong>If movement rate is greater than extinction rate then the
          metapopulation as a whole is stable</strong> - If extinction rate is
        less than movement rate then e/m will less than 1, and the equilibrium
        proportion of patches occupied will be greater than 0 - the
        metapopulation should be stable over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that what we mean by the metapopulation being stable over time is
      that it would not tend to go extinct overall. However, the fact that any
      given patch has a probability, e, of extinction means that we can expect a
      different set of patches to be occupied at any given time. In other words,
      we would expect a lot of unpredictable, random change in which patches we
      will actually find the species present at any given time, but extinctions
      would be balanced by colonizations, and the metapopulation as a whole
      should persist.</p>
    <h2>A metapopulation simulation app</h2>
    <p>Nice analytical models like the Levins model above have the advantage
      that you can use the structure of the equations to interpret what the
      model has to tell us about metapopulation dynamics, with the confidence
      that your interpretations are mathematically correct. However, to give you
      an idea of what the metapopulation model is actually saying is happening
      in the world, it is helpful to build a simulation.</p>
    <img src="data_source_bighorn.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 25%"><img
      src="BighornSheep_ownby1.jpg" style="float:right; width: 10%; margin-left: 10px">
    <p>The image to the left shows the data source we will use as the basis for
      a metapopulation simulation model - this is a map of the distribution of
      bighorn sheep in Colorado, made available by Colorado Parks and Wildlife
      (the green outline is the Colorado border, which can easily be mistaken
      for a shoe box). A picture of a bighorn sheep is on the right.</p>
    <p>Each of the red polygons is a patch of habitat where the sheep are found.
      Bighorn sheep prefer high-elevation, rocky habitat, and you can see that
      in this mountainous state their habitat is quite patchy. Each patch is
      potentially connected via movements by sheep between the patches, and each
      patch is subject to a local extinction of its sub-population.</p>
    <p>Just like we learned when we worked with population viability models, an
      analytical model can have terms in it that are actually <strong>expected
        values</strong> of a random variable. Although the equilibrium solution
      tells us to expect a stable metapopulation any time m is greater than e,
      both of these terms are probabilities, and we can expect in reality the
      number of movements and number of extinctions will randomly vary from one
      year to the next around these expected rates. The equilibrium patch
      occupancy will thus be subject to random variation.</p>
    <p>This matters, because according to the Levins model if the extinction
      probability is only slightly lower than movement rate (i.e. with e = 0.49
      and m = 0.5) then the metapopulation is expected to be stable (i.e. 1 -
      0.49/0.5 = 0.02, or 2% of patches occupied). However, with so few patches
      occupied it wouldn't take much random variation around this statistical
      expectation for those last patches to go extinct by chance, and the
      metapopulation could still be lost in spite of the non-zero p̂.</p>
    <p>Below is an app that includes all but the smallest of the patches in the
      actual map (there are 41 patches used by the app, but 56 in the image
      above; the patches omitted were very small and difficult to see).</p>

    <p>When you first see the map it is initialized with approximately 1/2 of
      the patches occupied. The movement rate is set to 0.5, meaning that the
      probability of a movement from one patch to another (occupied or not)
      during one run of the simulation is 0.5. The extinction rate is set to
      0.1, meaning that the probability of extinction from an occupied patch
      during one run of the simulation is 0.1. When you hit "Run again" you will
      see that the polygons change color - white indicates an unoccupied patch,
      and red indicate an occupied patch, and each time you run occupancy has
      the opportunity to change for each patch.</p>
    <p>Below the app you will see some numeric results. The proportion occupied
      (p) is given, as well as the number of colonizations (i.e. the number of
      unoccupied patches that received a movement from an occupied patch) and
      the number of extinctions (i.e. the number of occupied patches that lost
      their populations and became unoccupied). Note that the simulation does
      colonizations first, and then extictions, so it's possible that a patch
      can be colonized and then go extinct immediately. You thus may see a
      colonization recorded without any new patches turning red, because it went
      extinct immediately.</p>
    <p style="clear:both">To use the app to learn how metapopulation dynamics
      work, do the following (the letters correspond with questions on your
      worksheet):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A. Click "Run again" multiple times until the proportion occupied more
        or less stabilizes (10 or more should do it). You will see that occupied
        patches randomly go locally extinct, while others are randomly colonized
        by movements from occupied patches. The Levins model predicts that
        1-0.1/0.5 = 0.8, or 80% of the patches will be occupied at equilibrium.
        What is the typical proportion occupied when m is 0.5 and e is 0.1,
        according to this simulation model?</li>
      <li>B. If the habitat between patches had no effect on movement between
        the patches, and movements might be really common. Furthermore, the
        habitat within the patches might be really good, such that extinctions
        are really rare. To simulate this possibility, set movement to 0.95 and
        extinction to 0.01. What happens to the proportion occupied?</li>
      <li>C. If you set movement rate to 0.1 while leaving extinction at 0.01
        the Levins model predicts a high level of patch occupancy (the Levins
        model predicts 1-(0.01/0.1) = 0.9, or 90% occupancy). Set movement to
        0.1 while extinction is 0.01 and run multiple times. Do you still get
        extinctions? Do they stay unoccupied longer than in previous runs?</li>
      <li>D. The Levins model predicts exactly the same equilibrium p̂ if m =
        0.9 and e = 0.09 (because 1-0.09/0.9 = 0.9). Before changing to these
        values, first set movement to 0.9 while you leave extinction at 0.01 and
        run repeatedly to get close to all of the patches occupied. Then, leave
        m at 0.9 and set e to 0.09 and run again multiple times. Do you still
        get only occasional vacancies that are slow to be re-colonized, like you
        did when m was 0.1 and e was 0.01? Or are the extinct patches
        re-colonized faster?</li>
      <li>E. The Levins model predicts that the metapopulation model is unstable
        if e = m, even if they are very small numbers. With the map showing all
        or nearly all of the patches occupied after the previous run, set
        movement to 0.01 and extinction to 0.01. Run multiple times. What
        happens to the proportion occupied? If it's going down (as we expect),
        is it changing quickly?</li>
      <li>F. Set the movement to 0.95 and get those patches occupied again.
        Then, set the extinction rate to 0.95 as well, and run repeatedly. Did
        the metapopulation go extinct? Was it faster or slower than the previous
        run, with e and m set to 0.01? You can hit "Reset" to get your
        metapopulation back after it goes extinct.</li>
      <li>G. Let's see what it takes to make a stable metapopulation. We would
        expect that any values of m greater than e would do it, so let's try
        setting m to 0.6 and e to 0.5. Did the metapopulation go extinct?</li>
      <li>G (continued). We can crank up the movements to higher values - try
        0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 and see at what point the metapopulation stops rapidly
        going extinct.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that it takes a higher movement rate than the Levins model
      predicts to prevent extinction when we let random variation come into
      play. Notice also that a stable metapopulation does not necessarily have
      all of its patches occupied, or even a majority of them if extinction
      rates are high. Because of this we have to be careful about using the
      absence of a species to indicate that habitat is not suitable for it - it
      could be that the habitat is perfectly fine, but that the population has
      recently gone locally extinct and hasn't yet been re-colonized.</p>
    <h2>Limitations of the simple models</h2>
    <p>Simple models like these can give us insight into how a patchy population
      is expected to change over time, but we need to be careful about expecting
      the simple Levins model (or my simple-minded simulation app based on it)
      to predict how an actual population will behave. Consider some of the
      sources of un-reality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some patches are quite large, and others are much smaller, yet a
        single extinction rate is used for all of them. If all the patches have
        identical, suitable habitat we should expect the bigger patches to
        support bigger populations that are less likely to go extinct, and a
        single value of e doesn't reflect this.</li>
      <li>Some patches are close together and some are far apart, yet a single
        movement rate, m, is used for all movements between them. In other
        words, the model assumes that a sheep in a patch in the northwest corner
        of the map is equally likely to contribute colonists to a patch in the
        southeast corner as it is to move to the patch right next to it. Not
        likely to be true in the real world.</li>
      <li>Movements between patches will probably also be affected by the
        presence or absence of routes that are easy to move through. Since we
        are treating the "matrix" between the patches as gray, featureless space
        it isn't clear how this would matter, but if you look at the picture
        above you'll see that the patches cover most of the Rocky Mountains of
        Colorado. Some routes through mountains are much easier to traverse than
        others, and this will affect which patches the sheep will move between.</li>
      <li>Extinction rates are the same at all times for every patch. A
        colonization would be expected to involve just a few individuals, and
        for awhile the population size would be small. While the population is
        small it would be more prone to extinction, but would become less likely
        to go extinct if it persists long enough to grow to a more stable
        population size.</li>
      <li>Bigger populations will produce more colonists than smaller
        populations, but since we are ignoring population size we can't reflect
        this in our model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, if simple models like these are so unrealistic, why study them? </p>
    <p>The basic implications of the Levins model hold up when you add more
      complexity. For example, it is still the case that when movements balance
      extinctions a metapopulation can be stable, even when we account for more
      of the complexity of real populations with a more complicated model.
      Adding more realism to the model makes it a better predictor of how a
      particular species will change over time, and if we were doing this
      exercise in support of a conservation plan for bighorn sheep this gain in
      accuracy might be worth the added complexity. But, when the purpose is to
      just explore the behavior of metapopulations, with a minimum of complexity
      to confuse and confound us, the simple Levins model is still perfectly
      suitable.</p>
