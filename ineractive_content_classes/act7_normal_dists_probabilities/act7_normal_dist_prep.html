      <h2 class="part" id="why_normal">Why learn about the normal distribution</h2>
      <p> Probability distributions have a central place in statistical
        analysis. We already have experience with one probability distribution,
        the t-distribution, which we used to construct confidence intervals for
        estimated means. If you recall, we used the t-distribution as a
        mathematical model of a sampling distribution - that is, the
        distribution of means from many random samples drawn from the same
        population. We used the t-distribution to find how many standard errors
        we had to go from our sample mean to have a 95% chance of containing the
        population parameter we were estimating.</p>
      <p>We can also use probability distributions as mathematical models of our
        variables. You have already learned that biological variables, such as
        human height, can be thought of as <strong>random variables</strong>,
        because if we randomly pick a person from a population to measure we
        cannot know ahead of time exactly how tall he or she will be. The
        concept of a random variable is a mathematical abstraction, and there
        are probability distributions that are perfect descriptions of random
        variables that we can use as models of the actual biological variables
        we work with. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To illustrate, let's look again at this human histogram illustrating
        the distribution of heights of a sample of women.</p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="human_histo.png" name="graphics1" alt="Human histogram"
                style="float: left; padding: 10px; width: 384; height: 193;" onclick="var images=['human_histo_histo.png', 'human_histo_histo_normal.png', 'human_histo.png']; changeImage(this,images);">
              <p>The mean height for this sample is 65.6, and the standard
                deviation is 2.6. The histogram is formed by having women stand
                behind signs that indicate their height to the nearest inch, and
                you can see that the longest lines (i.e. the tallest bars on the
                histogram) are 65 and 66 inches, on either side of the mean. The
                distribution also looks fairly symmetrical - the heights of the
                bars drops off more or less evenly as you move away from the
                mean in either direction. We would conclude that a histogram
                like this is bell-shaped, in spite of the less than perfect
                symmetry.</p>
              <p>The red curve that has been roughly superimposed over the
                distribution of students is a <strong>normal distribution</strong>,
                and although no smooth curve can follow the square tops of bars
                on a histogram perfectly, the curve looks like a reasonably good
                fit to the data.</p>
              <p>If you click on the image it will change first to a MINITAB
                histogram of the height data, and then to a histogram with a
                normal curve drawn over it - you can see that the normal curve
                approximates the histogram's shape.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The normal curve doesn't match the histogram perfectly because the
        normal curve is smooth and symmetrical, whereas the human histogram is
        more uneven and not perfectly symmetrical around the mean. Additionally,
        the normal curve extends from negative infinity to positive infinity,
        and although the tails approach the x-axis asymptotically, the
        probability of heights that are impossibly high or impossibly low are
        not equal to 0 on the normal curve. Probability distributions are only
        ever approximations of the actual variables we use them to represent.</p>
      <p>So, if the fit is only approximate, why might we want to use the normal
        curve to represent this sample?<span style="font-family: &quot;Crimson Text&quot;,serif;">
        </span>There are a couple of reasons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Probability distributions model <strong>long run</strong>
          behavior. This particular sample of students has a couple of unusually
          tall individuals, and does not appear to be perfectly symmetrical. But
          if we were to use a different group of women we certainly would not
          get precisely the same distribution as this one, and if the next set
          didn't have unusually tall women but did have one or two unusually
          short women then the skew would seem to go the other way. The normal
          curve smooths out the quirks of our particular sample and predicts
          what a population would look like if we had an infinitely large number
          of people to measure.</li>
        <li>Probabilities of any value can be calculated, even ones that have
          not been observed. Probability distributions, by definition, must
          include all possible data values, and give the probabilities of every
          possible value. The sum of the probabilities of all the possible data
          values is 1, by definition. So, for a smooth curve like the normal
          distribution, this means that the area under the curve is equal to 1.
          The normal curve extends from negative infinity to positive infinity,
          which allows us to calculate a probability for any height.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, it is possible to calculate empirical probabilities from the
        data directly; for example, the probability that a woman in this
        population is 71 inches or taller based on the sample in the histogram
        above is a count of women that were 71 inches or taller (there are five:
        71, 71, 71, 72, and 73 inches tall) divided by the total number of women
        in the sample (119), or 5/119 = 0.042. </p>
      <p>But what if we want to know the probability of being 74 inches or
        taller? None of the women in this sample are that tall, so the
        probability estimate based just on our data would be 0/119 = 0. This is
        problematic, though, because a probability of 0 indicates an
        impossibility, and we know it isn't really impossible for a woman to be
        74 inches tall, we just didn't happen to include one in this sample. If
        instead we use the normal curve as a model for our population, we can
        easily calculate the probability of observing a woman that is 74 inches
        or taller, and the non-zero probability we calculate would be a much
        better representative of reality than the 0 empirical probability
        estimate obtained from our small sample of data.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="normal_prob"><b class="part" id="normal_prob">Using a normal
          distribution to calculate probabilities</b></h2>
      <p>The normal curve is defined by this formula:</p>
      <img src="normal_formula.png" alt="Normal curve">
      <p>There are several terms in this function, but two of them, π and e, are
        constants. The variable we are calculating probabilities for is x, and
        in the formula x represents a particular value of the variable. The
        other two terms are the <strong>parameters</strong> for the
        distribution: population mean (μ) and population standard deviation (σ).
        The mean is also referred to as the <strong>location</strong> of the
        distribution, because it determines where along the number line the
        curve is centered. The standard deviation is referred to as the <strong>scale</strong>
        of the distribution, because it determines the dispersion in the
        distribution.</p>
      <p>Since a normal distribution is defined by just these two parameters, we
        can find the normal curve that fits our height data by using the sample
        mean and the sample standard deviation in place of mu and sigma - the
        mean height of 65.6 inches, and the standard deviation of 2.6 inches
        define the normal distribution that is overlaid on the histograms.</p>
      <p>Normal distributions are continuous, smooth curves, with an area
        beneath them from -∞ to +∞ equal to 1. Probabilities from continuous
        probability distributions like the normal are always <strong>areas
          under the curve</strong>.</p>
      <p>This leads to a problem - an area implies both a width and a height,
        but a single data value is a point along the number line that don't have
        a width. The height of the curve (f(x)) at a single data value is
        therefore called the <strong>probability density</strong> for a data
        value. When we use continuous probability distributions like the normal
        curve, the probability density for a single data value is defined, but
        the <em>probability of obtaining any single data value is not defined</em>.</p>
      <p>So, with that in mind, let's look at how to calculate some
        probabilities from the normal distribution.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img style="padding: 10px; float: left;" src="ht_dist_noshade.png"

                is the normal distribution for the height data, with a mean
                height of 65.6 inches, and a standard deviation of 2.6 inches.</p>
              <p>What if we wanted to know the percentage of the population that
                falls above 69.5 inches, given this distribution?</p>
              <p>If you click on the image the part of the curve that is at or
                above 69.5 inches is shaded red, and it's this area under the
                curve that we need. Since the area under the curve from negative
                to positive infinity is equal to 1, the area under a portion of
                the curve will be between 0 and 1, as a probability has to be.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 405px; height: 270px; float: left; margin-right: 10px"
                alt="MINITAB prob" src="minitab_prob_1_5.png">
              <p>It's possible to use a computer to give us the probability -
                MINITAB allows you to specify a mean and standard deviation for
                the distribution, and define the region for which you want the
                probability. As you can see, based on MINITAB's calculation, the
                probability of being 69.5 inches or taller is 0.06681.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Another way to find this probability is to convert this distribution of
        heights into one for which probabilities have already been calculated
        and laid out in a table, and then look up the numbers from the table.
        The <strong>standard normal</strong> distribution, or <strong>z-distribution</strong>,
        is a special case of a normal distribution that has a mean of zero and
        standard deviation of one. Tables of probabilities for the
        z-distribution are included in every introductory statistics textbook,
        and a copy is provided for you to use below. To use the standard normal
        we just need to convert our curve of heights to one in which the mean is
        equal to 0, and the standard deviation is equal to 1. This is done using
        a <strong>z-transformation</strong><strong></strong>. </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="ztrans">The z-transformation</h3>
      <p><img alt="z transformation" src="z_transform.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 444px; height: 324px;">The
        z-transformation is really simple - subtracting the sample mean centers
        the distribution on 0 (i.e. the black data distribution slides left to
        center on 0, and becomes the red distribution). Dividing by the standard
        deviation converts the units of the data to standard deviation units,
        such that a 1 on the x-axis means 1 standard deviation (i.e. dividing
        the x-axis on the red distribution by its standard deviation of 2.6
        scales it to have a standard deviation of 1, and converts it to the blue
        distribution). Subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
        deviation gives the normal curve of heights a mean of 0 and a standard
        deviation of 1, and thus converts the curve for the height data into the
        standard normal.</p>
      <p>We can place a single data value, x<sub>i</sub>, on the standard normal
        distribution by subtracting the sample mean from it, and then dividing
        this difference by the standard deviation:<br>
        <img src="ztrans.jpg" name="graphics11" alt="ztrans" id="ztrans" border="0"
          width="121" align="bottom" height="80"><br>
        The x<sub>i</sub> indicates the number whose probability we want to
        calculate (69.5 for our example). The value calculated, z, is called the
        <strong>z-score</strong> for x<sub>i</sub>.</p>
      <p>To calculate a z-score for an x<sub>i</sub> of 69.5, we would plug 69.5
        in for x<sub>i</sub>, 65.6 for x̄, and 2.6 for s, to get:</p>
      <p> z = (69.5 - 65.6)/2.6 = 1.5</p>
      <p>A z-score of 1.5 tells us that 69.6 is 1.5 standard deviation above the
        mean. In other words, a height of 69.5 on the black curve of heights is
        equivalent to 1.5 on the blue standard normal curve.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The curve to the left is a standard normal distribution, and the shaded
        region is defined by the lower and upper z-values that you specify.
        Initially these z-values are set to -1 and 1, which gives the
        probability of falling within 1 standard deviation of the mean. </p>
      <p>Let's reproduce MINITAB's probability using this z-distribution. The
        probability of falling above a z-value is an <strong>upper-tail</strong>
        probability. To get the upper-tail probability of being taller than 69.5
        inches, you need to set the lower z-value to 1.5, and the upper z-value
        to a big number like 1000 (the correct value would be infinity, but the
        curve is so close to the x-axis at 1000 standard deviations that the
        probability will be the same to four decimal places as if we had used
        infinity). </p>
      <p>Once you set the z-values the upper tail will be shaded from 1.5 to
        positive infinity, and the area under the curve is the probability,
        which is equal to 0.0668, just like MINITAB told us it would be.</p>
      <p>If you set the lower z-value to 0 and the upper z-value to a big number
        (1000 or more) you'll see the probability is 0.5000 - which tells you
        that half of the distribution falls above 0. As you increase the lower
        limit so that an increasingly small amount of the upper half of the
        curve is shaded, you'll see the probabilities decline from 0.5 towards
        0. We can thus get any upper-tail probability we want this way.</p>
      <p>But, if you don't have MINITAB handy, or a friendly statistics
        instructor to make a normal probability app for you, you can still solve
        normal probability problems using the z-distribution. All you need is a
        z-table.</p>

          scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
      <h3 class="part">Probability from a z-table</h3>
      <p>A version of the table to the right can be found in any statistics
        book. As the title says, it gives upper-tail probabilities for the
        standard normal distribution. All you need to do is to find your
        z-value, and then look up the probability in the body of the table. The
        z-values are given to two decimal places. To look up a z-value you need
        to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the first two digits of the z-value (including the whole number
          and the first decimal place) in the rows of the first column. For a
          z-value of 1.50, the right row is 1.5.</li>
        <li>Find the third digit of the z-value (the second decimal place) in
          the column headings. For a z-value of 1.50, the correct column is 0.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The green cell that is highlighted when you hover in the 1.5 row and 0
        column contains the probability, which is 0.067 - this is the
        probability of a woman in our population being 69.5 inches or taller,
        and it matches the value you got from the curve and from MINITAB,
        rounded to three decimal places. </p>
      <p>Recall that probabilities can be thought of as proportions of a total,
        and we can convert to percentages by multiplying by 100. Our probability
        of 0.067 tells us to expect 6.7% of this population of women to be 69.5
        inches or taller.</p>
      <p>Note that this table starts at 0.00, and doesn't include any negative
        numbers. Negative z-values are just values below the mean, so this table
        seems to only be capable of giving a) upper tail probabilities that b)
        are below the mean. Compared to using MINITAB or the applet, above, this
        seems limited - both MINITAB and the applet can calculate any range of
        values, in either tail of the distribution.</p>
      <p>However, it turns out that with a little ingenuity we can use this
        z-table to obtain probabilities for any ranges of z-values that fall
        between -3.09 and +3.09. Additionally, we can use this upper-tail table
        to find lower-tail probabilities (i.e. probabilities of values less than
        or equal to z). </p>
      <p>What if we wanted to know the proportion of women that are shorter than
        61.7 inches, where (61.7 - 65.6)/2.6 = -1.5? This is a lower-tail
        probability, how do we get that from an upper-tail table?</p>

                  -1.5 standard deviations (0.933, shown in red on the graph on

                  You can see in these graphs that all of the values we want to
                  retain are in the graph on the left, and the values we want to
                  exclude are in the middle graph. To get the probability of
                  falling between -1.5 and 1.5 we just need to subtract the
                  probability of being above 1.5 from the probability of being
                  above -1.5, which leaves the shaded area between them (shown

      <h2 class="part" id="dont_use">When should you not use a normal curve to
        represent your data? And how do you know?</h2>
      <p>The short answer to the first question is that we should not use a
        probability distribution as a model for our data when the probability
        distribution does not match our data. It should be pretty obvious that
        we can't expect the normal curve to do a good job representing our data
        if our data are not normally distributed. The harder question is, how do
        we know when our data are or are not normally distributed? </p>

              <p>If we look at the distribution of body lengths from our bears
                data set to the left, you can see the problems we have in making

                normal curve superimposed over it does not match perfectly. The
                distribution of heights of women, above, didn't match the normal
                distribution perfectly either, so how do we know when the
                mismatch is bad enough to reject the normal distribution as a
                model for our data? </p>

              <p>There are a variety of ways that normality can be assessed, but
                one effective way is through a <strong>normal probability plot</strong>.
                Normal probability plots compare how the data actually <em>are</em>
                distributed against how they <em>would</em> be distributed if
                they were from a normal distribution. How they would be
                distributed is determined by percentiles - percentiles for the
                data set are evaluated from the sorted data set, and the
                percentiles expected if the data were normally distributed come
                from lower-tail probabilities.</p>
              <p>For example, the shortest length in this data set is 36. With
                143 data values, the smallest data point is expected to have
                1/143 of the data values at or below it, where 1/143 is
                0.006993, or 0.6993th percentile. If the data are normally
                distributed with a mean of 61.28 and a standard deviation of
                9.352, the length that has a probability of 0.006993 is 38.296 -
                thus, the data value should be equal to 38.296 - close, but not
                identical, to the smallest data value. The next smallest data
                value is 37, which is the 2/143 = 0.014, or 1.4th percentile.
                For the normal distribution, the data value with a probability
                of 0.014 is 40.72 - again, close but not identical.</p>
              <img src="probplot1.png" name="graphics7" alt="probplot" style="width: 428px; height: 313px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
              <p>If we continue to do this calculation for each of the data
                values, we would get an observed data value paired with a value
                expected if the data were normally distributed for each data
                point, and we could then plot them to see how well they match
                overall. The graph to the left is MINITAB's normal probability
                plot for these length data.</p>
              <p>Let's walk through the elements of the graph that you need to
                know to understand what it's showing you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> The x-axis is the observed data values</li>
                <li>The y-axis is the expected data values. The y-axis is scaled
                  so that a perfect match between observed and expected forms a
                  straight line on the graph. </li>
                <li>The red dots are the pairs of observed data values and
                  expected values.</li>
                <li>The straight blue diagonal line is where all the red dots
                  would fall if there was a perfect match between the data and
                  the normal distribution. We want the red dots to fall as close
                  to this line as possible, and would like not to see any
                  patterning to the deviations away from it (for example, no
                  curving pattern)</li>
                <li>The slightly curved lines on either side of the straight
                  diagonal line are <strong>prediction limits</strong>, which
                  are like confidence intervals. As long as no more than 5% of
                  the red dot fall outside of the prediction limits the data are
                  considered a sufficiently good match to the normal
                  distribution to use it to represent our data.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The points on this graph do not follow the diagonal line
                perfectly, but they do fall mostly between the prediction
                limits. With 143 data points we don't want to see more than 0.05
                x 143 = 7.15 data points falling outside of the prediction limits,
                and it looks like there are only three or four that do.</p>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to this graph, MINITAB reports the results of a
                goodness of fit test, called the <strong>Anderson-Darling test</strong>.
                The Anderson-Darling test measures how much difference there is
                between the observed data and what would be expected if the data
                were normally distributed, and produces the AD statistic from
                these differences. Perfectly normal data will have no difference
                between observed and expected values, and will have an AD value
                of 0. AD values get bigger as data diverges from normal.</p>
              <p>The AD test uses the AD statistic to get a <strong>p-value</strong>.
                A p-value is a probability of obtaining the AD statistic if the
                data are actually normally distributed. Small differences
                between observed and expected values will happen by chance, and
                thus the p-value generated from a small AD value will be large.
                Big differences between observed and expected values shouldn't
                happen very often by chance, and thus large AD values will
                generate small p-values. Whether a p-value is large or small is
                a judgment call, but the typical dividing line is p = 0.05. </p>
              <p>We're going to learn much, much more about statistical tests
                and p-values, but for now remember that this all boils down to a
                simple decision rule:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If the p-value is less than 0.05, you fail the test - your
                  data are not normally distributed.</li>
                <li>If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, you pass
                  the test - you can consider your data to be normally
                  distributed.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The AD value reported for the bear length data is 0.583, and
                P-Value is 0.127. We would conclude based on the AD test that
                the data are normally distributed (or, at least they are close
                enough that we can treat them as normally distributed).</p>

              <p>For comparison, look at the really non-normal distribution of
                body weights for bears in the histogram to the left - there are
                two modes, a small one on the right for big males and a bigger
                one on the left for females and juveniles.</p>
              <p>Since the normal curve does not overlap well with the histogram
                at all, it isn't surprising to see that our normal probability
                plot on the right shows the data diverging from the center line
                by quite a lot, with multiple points falling outside of the
                outer lines. There is also a distinct arching pattern in the
                data, and patterning like this is problematic - it happens when
                the data have a consistent distributional pattern, but the
                pattern isn't normal.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the AD test gives us a p-value less than 0.005 -
                both the graph and the AD test indicate the data are not
                normally distributed.</p>
              <p>Consequently, we might feel confident using the normal
                distribution as a model for our bear lengths, but would not want
                to use it as a model for our bear weights.</p>

        nature? </h2>
      <p>Many biological variables have bell-shaped distributions that are
        well-represented by a normal curve, which is why the curve was called
        "normal" - bell-shaped curves are so commonly found in nature that the
        discoverer of the normal distribution, Carl Friedrich Gauss, considered
        it to be the usual, expected distribution of data.</p>
      <p>But why would that be? Let's look at a simple illustration.</p>

              <p>Consider a simple case from quantitative genetics. Imagine that
                height is controlled by a single gene that has only two alleles,
                one "tall" and one "short" allele. Furthermore, imagine this is
                a case of incomplete dominance, meaning that heterozygotes that
                have one short and one tall allele are of intermediate height. </p>
              <p>If we let these short and tall alleles mix together randomly in
                the population, two shorts will mix together sometimes and give
                us shorter than average people, two talls will mix together to
                give us taller than average people, and a short and a tall will
                mix together to give us people of average height. Since you can
                get a mix of short and tall in two different ways (tall from
                mom, short from dad; or, short from mom, tall from dad) there
                will be more people of average height than there are shorter or
                taller people. The distribution should look like the one on the
                left. You can click on the image and it will change from "Number
                of tall alleles" to height, to show you there are only three
                possible heights in the population based on the number of tall
                alleles a person carries.</p>
              <p>The distribution is somewhat bell-shaped already, but doesn't
                show the kind of continuous variation we expect in a normal
                biological population. But this is because we imagined a very
                simplified case - traits like height are usually "polygenic",
                which means they are controlled by many genes instead of just
                one.</p>

              <p>For example, with just three genes contributing to height, each
                of which has one tall and one short allele, the distribution of
                heights looks like this graph, with seven different heights
                depending on the total number of tall alleles present at the
                three loci.</p>
              <p>If you click on the graph you'll see the range of heights has
                been kept the same, so each gene is having a smaller effect.
                We're assuming that each gene has the same amount of influence
                on height, so that we can express height as the number of tall
                alleles possessed.</p>

              <p>With 25 genes we can have from 0 to 50 tall alleles, and the
                distribution looks like this.</p>
              <p> You can see that as we add more genes the distribution of
                heights (as indicated by the number of "tall" alleles) begins to
                more and more closely resemble a bell shaped curve. The range of
                heights is still the same as the other two graphs, so each
                individual gene is having a very small effect on height. The
                collective contributions of many genes of small effect is giving
                us a fairly continuous, bell-shaped distribution.</p>

      <p>Studies of human height have found over 100 genes involved, so this
        example with 25 genes still is less complex than the actual story. Once
        you add in some environmental variation and developmental processes that
        modify the effects of the genes these discrete numbers will blend even
        more until they become a continuous distribution.</p>
      <p>So, to answer the original question about why normal curves are common
        in nature... it turns out that in nature many variables are affected by
        large numbers of small, random, additive factors that tend to produce
        bell-shaped distributions. Thus, many of the variables we work with can
        be represented well using normal distributions.</p>

      <p> In this week's activity, we will measure some body dimensions for the
        students in this class, test whether they are normally distributed, and
        then calculate some probabilities from the normal curves that correspond
        with one of the variables. </p>
