      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Today we are going to re-visit the lung cancer survival data, but
        instead of log-transforming our troubles away we're going to try using a
        Mann-Whitney U-test and a randomization test to analyze the data
        instead. All three of these are supposed to be alternative ways of
        testing whether there is a difference in survival time between groups,
        but each addresses the question in a different way. We will see at the
        end whether they all arrive at the same conclusions.</p>
      <p>The randomization test will take more time to do, and you will need to
        wait for a class data set to finish it. Do your part of generating the
        class data set, and enter your data into the class database first. You
        can then work on the Mann-Whitney U-test while you're waiting for the
        rest of the class data.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="randtest">Randomization testing</h2>
      <p>We will re-visit the lung cancer survival time data for patients with
        small cell or large cell cancers that we worked with last time to see
        how randomization tests can be used to test for differences between
        means, even when the data aren't normal.</p>
      <p>Under the null hypothesis, the survival times are the same for small
        and large-cell cancers - the cell type grouping is a distinction without
        a difference. If the null is true, the 94.4 week difference between
        large and small cell cancer mean survival times we observed should be
        easy to generate if we randomly shuffle the data between the groups.
        This random shuffling of data mimics the process of drawing two samples
        repeatedly from a population, such that there is only one population
        mean that is the same for both samples. The differences between the
        means of randomly shuffled groups are used as our sampling distribution,
        in place of the t-distribution. </p>

      <p>The app to the left shows the cancer survival data in the table -
        initially the groups are correctly assigned, and the large mean, small
        mean, and difference between them are all equal to their observed
        values. The difference between means is our <strong>test statistic</strong>
        for this test - it is the measure of difference we are using to test if
        the difference between population means is 0. The difference is
        highlighted in red because any difference between means that we generate
        with an absolute value of 94.4 or larger will show in red, and will add
        to the "Number exceeding 94.4" count. Under the null hypothesis the
        observed difference of 94.4 is a randomly generated difference, so it is
        being added both as one of the random shuffles, and is treated as one of
        the random shuffles exceeding 94.4 - consequently, the "Number of random
        shuffles" and "Number exceeding 94.4" both read 1.</p>
      <p>The p-value is just the number of random shuffles exceeding 94.4
        divided by the total number of random shuffles generated, with 1 added
        to the numerator and denominator for the observed data. Before you start
        generating random shuffles there is just the observed data in both the
        numerator and denominator, and p-value starts at a value of 1.</p>
      <p>Now that you understand what the app is showing you, you can use it to
        see how randomization testing works.<br>
      </p>
      <p>1. <strong>Hit "Randomize" once to generate your first random shuffle</strong>.
        When you hit the "Randomize" button the labels for cancer type are
        randomly shuffled, while the survival times stay in place, which has the
        effect of randomly assigning the data values to new groups. The means
        for the new groups are calculated, and the resulting difference between
        them is reported. If the difference is not as big as the observed
        difference of 94.4 the difference turns black (which is very likely what
        happened). The number of random shuffles increases to 2, but the number
        exceeding 94.4 remains at 1, so the p-value is now 0.5.</p>
      <p>If you hit "Randomize" again a few times you'll see that the p-value
        declines each time you get a random shuffle with differences between
        means less than 94.4.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Continue to hit "Randomize" until p is less than 0.05</strong>.
        Since the denominator of our p-value calculation is the number of random
        shuffles we generate, it will take at least a count of 20 random
        shuffles (which is actually the observed data plus 19 random
        differences) for p to equal 0.05. When the number of random shuffles
        counter hits 21 the p will be less than 0.05 (unless you get a rare
        difference greater than 94.4, in which case it will take an extra
        shuffle).</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Continue to hit "Randomize" until p is less than 0.01</strong>.
        Record how many random shuffles it took, and how many differences
        exceeded 94.4 on your worksheet.</p>
      <p>4. Clicking buttons is fun and all, but it would get tedious to do this
        enough times to get a p-value that is 1 in 10,000 (0.0001), so I
        generated 10,000 differences for you. Download <a href="large_small_differences.mtw">this
          MINITAB worksheet</a>, which contains 10,000 random random differences
        between randomly shuffled groups. Make a histogram of the differences,
        and you will see that it resembles a bell-shaped sampling distribution
        of test statistics, much like a t-distribution.</p>
      <p>5. To see how many of the 10,000 differences exceed 94.4 do the
        following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Open the MINITAB calculator.</li>
        <li>Enter "Exceeds" in the "Store result in variable" box.</li>
        <li>In the expression box enter: abs("Differences") &gt;= 94.4</li>
        <li>Click "OK" to execute the expression and put the results in the
          "Exceeds" column.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> This expression calculates the absolute value of each difference
        (abs()), and compares each to 94.4. If the value is greater than or
        equal to 94.4 the expression returns a 1, and if it is less than 94.4 it
        returns a 0.</p>
      <p>Now, to count up how many of the differences exceeded 94.4 you just
        need to sum up the Exceeds column. Do this with "Display descriptives",
        using "Exceeds" as the "Variable", and include only the "Sum" as a
        statistic to display. </p>
      <p>Note that you could get a sum of the number of differences that exceed
        94.4 in a single step using the calculator - you could use the
        expression:</p>
      <p>sum(abs("Differences") &gt;= 94.4)</p>
      <p>which would compare the absolute values of the differences to 94.4, and
        then sum them before reporting the result in the "Exceeds" column. This
        is more compact, but it's easier to see what is happening if you do the
        calculation in two steps.</p>
      <p>Answer the questions on your worksheet about randomization testing.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="mann_whitney"> Mann-Whitney U test</h2>
      <p> The last analysis we'll do on these data is to compare the medians
        between the two groups using a Mann-Whitney U-test. Mann-Whitney U tests
        don't require that the data are normally distributed, but the
        distributions should be the same between the groups. Since the
        distributions are both right-skewed, we can apply this test to our
        survival data.</p>
      <p>You can use <a href="lung_cancer_survival_unstacked.MTW">this file</a>
        for the analysis, which is the same survival data again but organized in
        an "unstacked" manner, with a column for each cell type. MINITAB can by
        a funny beast at times, and it isn't always consistent in its approach
        from one test type to the next - since we're making a comparison between
        two independent samples we should be able to used stacked data, with a
        column of measured data and a column of group identifiers (like we did
        for two-sample t-tests), but MINITAB doesn't want that here. Other than
        the organization, these are the same data as you analyzed using a log
        transformation in the previous activity, and that you just analyzed
        using a randomization test.</p>
      <p> 1. To run the test, select "Stat" → "Nonparametrics" → "<a href="mann_whitney.jpg">Mann-Whitney</a>".</p>
      <p> 2. In the form that pops up, put "large cell survival" into the first
        sample box, and "small cell survival" into the second. Leave the
        confidence level at 95% and the alternative as "not equal", and click
        OK.</p>
      <p>The output gives median survival times for each group (Greek "eta"
        symbols represent the population median), and an "Estimation for
        difference", which is reported to be 89.5. Given the labeling it seems
        as though this should just be the difference in medians between the
        groups, but it isn't - instead, MINITAB calculates differences between
        all possible pairs of data points for small and large-cell survival
        times, and then reports the median of these differences as the point
        estimate.</p>
      <p>There are two reported results of the null hypothesis test - the first
        is labeled "Not adjusted for ties", and the second is labeled "Adjusted
        for ties". Ties refer to data values that are the same, and that have
        the same rank. The first result, not adjusted for ties, uses the W
        statistic to calculate a p-value based on a normal approximation (we
        talked about this in lecture - if the sample sizes are over 30 this is
        the preferred approach). The second option, which adjusts for ties, uses
        the Mann-Whitney U distribution for the p-value (which is preferred when
        the sample sizes are less than 30). We have over 30 in one group, but
        under 30 in the other, so we should prefer the adjusted for ties
        approach. In this instance the results are identical regardless of which
        we choose, so it doesn't matter which we report, but you should
        understand the differences between them so you can pick the correct one
        when the medians are not the same.</p>
      <p> 3. Answer the questions on your assignment sheet pertaining to the
        test results.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p>Many species come into breeding condition only under particular
        circumstances. Many are seasonal breeders, and during non-breeding
        seasons females will be non-receptive, and males will often be
        non-agressive towards each other. Cichlid fish become reproductively
        active due to social interactions, in that males will increase
        reproductive hormone levels (such as "gonadotropin releasing hormone",
        or GnRH) when they are in the presence of other males.</p>
      <p> To test whether the presence of other males affects levels of GnRH,
        researchers placed males in tanks by themselves, making them
        non-territorial, or in the presence of other males, making them
        territorial. They they measured the GnRH levels in territorial and
        non-territorial males. The data are <a href="gnrh_cichlids_data.MTW">here</a>
        in the first two columns, Territorial status and GnRH level.</p>
      <p>1. Test for HOV using an F-test. Do you have HOV?</p>
      <p>2. Test for normality. Do you pass the normality test?</p>
      <p>3. Why might you want to avoid doing a two-sample t-test on these data?
        Note that the sample sizes are not identical between the two groups.</p>
      <p>The researchers decided to do a randomization test to compare mean GnRH
        levels between the groups. The differences between randomly re-grouped
        GnRH levels are given in column "Rand diffs". The differences are sorted
        from smallest to largest.</p>
      <p>4. What is the observed difference between means?</p>
      <p>5. How many of the random differences exceeded the observed difference
        (that is, how many absolute values of random differences were greater
        than or equal to the absolute value of the observed difference)?</p>
      <p>6. What is the p-value for this test?</p>
      <p>7. Was this a one-tailed or two-tailed test?</p>
      <p>8. Now, conduct a Mann-Whitney U test for the same data. Report the
        difference in medians, the W test statistic, and the p-value.</p>
      <p>9. What conclusion can you draw from this test regarding the effect of
        territoriality on GnRH levels in male cichlids? Do the two different
        non-parametric tests lead to the same conclusion?</p>
