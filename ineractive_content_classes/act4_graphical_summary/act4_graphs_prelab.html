      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Why we graph data</h2>
      <p>Graphs serve two distinct purposes in statistics, both of which are
        very important: 1) guiding your own data analysis and interpretation,
        and 2) presenting and communicating your results to others. For
        convenience, we'll refer to the graphs used for these two purposes as <strong>statistical
          graphs</strong> and <strong>summary graphs</strong>, respectively.</p>
      <p>Statistical graphs help us understand the data we are analyzing better.
        We will focus today on histograms as examples of statistical graphs (we
        will learn about additional ones, like normal probability plots and
        residual plots, later in the semester).</p>
      <p>Summary graphs are for communicating results, and we have to choose the
        right graph so that we can convey our results accurately. The choice of
        which summary graph type we use is based in part on the type of
        variables we are displaying, and in part on what we learn about our data
        from our statistical graphs. So far we've learned about one summary
        graph type, the interval plot (in which a mean and an error bar are used
        to illustrate the central tendency and dispersion in the data), and we
        will learn several others now.</p>
      <p>Graphs are often the simplest, clearest way of presenting results, and
        can be a very powerful way of communicating our findings to others.
        However, graphs can also be used in a way that obscures information, and
        can be misleading if misused (graphs are a great way to "lie with
        statistics", whether you mean to or not).</p>
      <p>In spite of their potential for misuse, graphs should be used
        routinely. I strongly recommend that you never analyze data, or try to
        interpret a result, without thoroughly exploring the data graphically
        first - it will save you from making big mistakes of interpretation. So,
        whatever else you do, always LOOK AT YOUR DATA!</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="histo">Statistical graphs help you make good choices
        in your analysis</h2>
      <p><img alt="Distribution of bear weights" src="smooth_wts.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">A
        variable like weight of bears is a continuous numeric variable, which
        can take any number on the number line. If we had complete information
        about the distribution of weights we would expect to see a smooth curve
        like the one to the left. The y-axis is labeled "density", which is a
        measure of how common each weight is. Adult male bears are much bigger
        than the adult females and juveniles, so we see a second mode at about
        360 kg where the adult males are. The larger mode is made up of adult
        females and juveniles of both sexes.</p>
      <p>Unless we are using a computer simulation we never know what the smooth
        curve for the distribution of a continuous variable actually looks like,
        and we can only approximate them based on the information we have in a
        data set. One of the graphical methods we use for approximating the
        shape of the smooth curve underlying the data is to use a histogram.</p>
      <p>We saw histograms before when we learned to diagnose the shape of a
        distribution so that we could select the right numerical summary. Now we
        will delve deeper into the choices we get to make in constructing
        histograms, and how those choices affect how well we approximate the
        variable's distribution.</p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Alternative binning" src="default_histo_weight.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 10px;"
                onclick="swapImage(this, 'default_histo_weight.jpg', 'alt_bins_weight.jpg')">
              <p> If we use MINITAB to make a histogram from the 143 bear
                weights we have to work with, we get a histogram that looks like
                the one to the left (the smooth curve is superimposed here to
                help you envision what you are trying to approximate, but it
                won't appear when you make your own).</p>
              <p>The number of bins MINITAB uses is determined by a statistical
                rule of thumb, which is based on the number of data points in
                the data set. In this graph there are 13 bins, each 40 kg wide.
              </p>
              <p>Ideally, a histogram will closely approximate the shape of the
                underlying distribution of the variable, including any skew or
                more than one mode, with a minimum of raggedness in the profile.
                This histogram is very nice in that way - it is possible to see
                the small second mode at 360 kg, and the bar heights make a
                nice, smooth profile across the top of the bars that closely
                follows the smooth curve. From this histogram we can easily see
                this distribution is <strong>bimodal</strong> (i.e. has two
                modes).</p>
              <p>But, keep in mind that we are breaking up a continuous variable
                on the x-axis into bins in order to count frequencies of data
                points, and the choice of where to put the bins is up to us. </p>
              <p>If you click on the image you'll see what would happen if we
                used bins that were still 40 kg wide but started 20 units lower.
                The overall impression is similar, but the profile is not
                identical to the one before, and the second mode shows up at 340
                kg instead of 360 kg. The histogram's profile is still a
                reasonable approximation of a smooth curve.</p>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Lots of bins" src="too_many_bins.jpeg" style="float: left; padding: 10px;"
                onclick="swapImage(this, 'too_many_bins.jpeg', 'not_enough_bins.jpeg')">
              <p>The rule of thumb MINITAB uses for picking the number of bins
                works well most of the time, but we don't have to accept the
                default - the choice is up to us.</p>
              <p>If you look at the default MINITAB histogram above the bars are
                so wide that they look like stair steps rather than a smooth
                curve. If we had more, narrower bins we would have smaller
                steps, and could follow the smooth curve more closely. Provided,
                that is, that the sample size was large enough.</p>
              <p>If we increase the number of bins for the sample size we have,
                like in the histogram to the left, instead of following the
                underlying smooth curve better we get a very jagged profile.
                This happens because we are getting lots of bars with heights of
                1 because only one data value falls inside of them, many with
                heights of 0 with no points inside of them at all, and the
                occasional bar with a height other than 0 or 1 due to chance
                clustering of small numbers of data points. The bimodality of
                the data isn't obvious anymore, and the jaggedness of the
                profile makes it difficult to judge the shape of the
                distribution at all.</p>
              <p>Using too few bins is also a problem. If you click on the graph
                you'll see what the histogram looks like when only 3 bins are
                used. The profile is nice and smooth, but the bins are so wide
                that the second mode isn't visible anymore. The data look like
                they may be right-skewed, but only one mode is shown.</p>
              <p></p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>To sum up: a good histogram is one that shows the important features of
        a data set, such as its shape, and presence of more than one mode. This
        means picking a number of bins that smooths the data enough, but not too
        much. Bigger sample sizes can support a larger number of bins, and
        MINITAB picks a default number that balances the number of bins against
        the sample size. However, if the default MINITAB histogram looks very
        ragged in profile, or has some gaps between bars, you might try reducing
        the default number. If the bins are very wide such, you might try using
        more and see how your impression of the shape changes. The rules of
        thumb for optimal numbers of bins are good starting points, but you may
        need to change them to suit your purposes.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="summary">Summary graphs</h2>
      <p>We'll move on now to summary graphs. As you now know, the kind of
        numeric summary you should use depends on the variable type, and the
        same is true for graphs.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="freq">Summary graphs for a single categorical
        variable</h3>
      <p>Recall that the best summary for a categorical variable is either the
        frequency of each level, or the relative frequency of each level. If we
        had some data on bears from a study of a wild population conducted over
        several years, we could count up how many bears were observed each month
        during the course of the study, like so:</p>

              <p>A nominal variable could also be displayed this way, but the

                nicer, and to make it easier to see how the frequencies compare

                that is, data that can be interpreted as proportions of a total.
                Pie charts are okay, but notice that you lose the y-axis, so you
                can't easily tell what the relative frequency is for each
                category. The ordering of the months is maintained, but it's not
                obvious, and you need to compare the legend to the chart to be
                sure. The principle advantage of pie charts is that the sizes of

      <p> If the data are symmetrical, interval plots are a good choice,
        although boxplots are fine as well for symmetrical data.</p>
      <div style="display:none;" id="skewdir">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> The box is longer in the
          positive direction, so it's positively skewed. </p>
      </div>
      <p>If the data are skewed, boxplots are a better choice than interval
        plots, because boxplots show the skew. If the data are skewed, the box
        will be asymmetrical, and the longer half will point in the direction of
        the skew. For example, if the data are positively skewed, the third
        quartile will be further from the median than the first quartile is, and
        box will be longer in the positive direction. Conversely, if the data
        are negatively skewed the first quartile will be further from the median
        than the third quartile, and the box will be longer in the negative
        direction. </p>
      <p>Given this, which direction is the skew in chest girths for males? <a

          if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div id="skew_m" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> The box is longer in the
          positive direction, so chest girth is positively skewed for males. </p>
      </div>
      <p>What about for females? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay%28%27skew_f%27%29">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a> </p>
      <div id="skew_f" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> The box is symmetrical for
          females - both sides are the same size on either side of the median.
          So, female chest girths are not skewed. </p>

      <h3>Graphs of relationships between variables<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Some studies don't use a numeric, measured variable grouped into
        categories, so we will finish up with some graphs that are useful for
        showing relationships between various combinations of numeric and
        categorical variables.</p>

                measurements is used as a Cartesian x,y coordinate that places
                the point on the graph.</p>
              From this graph, you can see there is a fairly strong tendency for
              neck girth to increase as chest girth increases.</td>

              <p>Line graphs are similar to scatter plots in appearance, but
                they are meant for series of successive measurements, usually
                over time. Time goes on the x-axis, and the measurements go on
                the y-axis. Because the data values are taken successively over
                time, lines are used to connect the dots so that the change over
                time is easier to see.</p>
              <p>In this case, two different groups are being displayed on the
                same graph (male and female) indicated with different plot
                symbols and different colors. This is actually a plot of three
                variables: weight, sex, and time.</p>

      <h4> DANGER: line graphs are easy to misuse, and can be misleading</h4>
      <p>A couple of important points about line graphs: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The lines between the points are not data values, they are
          interpolations between data values. So, even though they are the most
          conspicuous feature of the graph, they are not the measured data. </li>
        <li>It makes sense to connect dots if there is a natural ordering to the
          points that needs to be made clear. The most common case in which this
          is needed is when measurements are taken over time. However, if your
          data don't have a natural ordering along the x-axis, then connecting
          dots with lines is not appropriate. </li>
        <li>Although it's possible to produce graphs like the one above that use
          a numeric x-axis, in most programs (including MINITAB and Excel),
          "line graphs" have <em>categorical x-axes</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="No September" src="line_plot_alldata.png" style="float: left; padding: 10px;"
                onclick="var images=['line_plot_alldata.png','line_plot_nosummer.png', 'scatter_nosummer.png']; changeImage(this, images)">
              <p>The last point requires some additional explanation. The x-axis
                of the example of a line graph looks quantitative because all of
                the months are present in the data set, and the months are all
                equally spaced apart. </p>
              <p>But, if you click once on the image you'll see what the graph
                would look like if the data set was missing observations in the
                middle of the summer, from June to August (the graph titled
                "Line Plot of Mean(Weight) - no summer data"). You'll see that
                the numbers on the x-axis keep their even spacing even though
                the numbers jump from 4 to 5 to 9.</p>
              <p>To represent the actual spacing between the months, we need to
                use a scatter plot of the means, which uses a quantitative
                x-axis. If you click the image again (to get "Scatterplot of
                Weight vs. Month") you'll see the spacing between the months is
                now correct.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>You should also see why lines should be interpreted with some caution -
        the lines that connect month 5 to month 9 make it look like we know that
        there is a smooth transition between May and September weights, but
        that's not actually the case in the full data set. Sometimes in order to
        make the lines look better on the graph the points are omitted, which
        further obscures the data that the graph is actually based on. The lines
        may be the most conspicuous part of a line graph, but they are also the
        least reliable - the dots show where the actual data are. </p>
      <h4>Summary graphs for relationships between two categorical variables</h4>
      <p>Two categorical variables are summarized by counting frequencies of
        levels that both occur together - this is a <strong>cross tabulation</strong>
        of two categorical variables. For example, we could count up how many
        times males and females were observed each month of the bear study,
        which would give us a table like this:</p>

                with spaces between months.</p>
              <p>This presentation allows you to compare frequencies of each sex

                comparisons of overall numbers by month easier, because the
                heights of each two-colored bar is the total number of
                observations. The relative number of females and males within a
                bar is still easy to tell, and the number of females is easy to
                read from the y-axis. However, the number of males is not as
                easy to get from this graph, since red portions of the bars
                start above 0.</p>

                relative frequencies of males and females within each moth. Each
                month's bar goes to 100%, so that changes in the relative number
                of males and females is evident. This approach allows you to
                focus on changes in relative numbers of each sex from month to
