      <p> Today you will learn how to fit non-linear functions to data using least squares in order to obtain estimates
        of the function's coefficients.</p>

      <table style="width: 100%">

          <tr>
            <td>
              <p><img src="6400_instr.png" alt="Instrument" hspace="10" align="left">We will use the same kind of
                photosynthesis data used as an example in lecture. Net photosynthesis can be measured at varying light
                levels by a portable photosynthesis system like the one pictured to the left. A leaf is placed in the
                machine's chamber, and light levels are set by the machine. The rate of depletion of CO<sub>2</sub> from
                the chamber is a measure of carbon fixation through photosynthesis, so the data produced by the system
                is a set of light levels and photosynthesis rates. Thus, both light level and net photosynthesis are
                known quantities.</p>

              <p> <img alt="Curve" style="width: 218px; height: 192px;" src="typical_photosynth_curve.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="10"
                  align="left">Light level is set by the machine, making it the independent variable (x-axis), and net
                photosynthesis is measured in response (y-axis). However, the shape of the response between these two
                variables is not a straight line, as you can see from the graph of a typical photosynthesis curve shown
                to the left. Photosynthesis rises quickly at very low light levels because the leaf can't
                photosynthesize at all without it. Photosynthesis asymptotically approach a maximum when the
                photosynthetically active tissue is fixing carbon as quickly as it possibly can. Photosynthesis is thus
                limited by light availability at low light levels, which causes the curve to drop rapidly below a value
                of about 500.</p>

      </table>
      <p>To better understand why the curve is shaped this way a model of how plants convert light into fixed carbon has
        been developed:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <img src="equation.jpg" alt="Equation"></p>
      <p> You'll see that two of the terms in the equation are data values:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Q = light intensity (the independent variable, set by the photosynthesis system)</li>
        <li> Pnet = net photosynthesis (the response variable, measured by the photosynthesis system)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The other three terms are biophysical properties of the leaf that allow it to convert light energy into fixed
        carbon:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> φ = lower-case Greek Phi = maximum quantum yield (measure of efficiency of conversion from light energy to
          chemical energy)</li>
        <li> θ = lower-case Greek Theta = Convexity of the curve (a dimensionless constant)</li>
        <li> P<sub>marea</sub> = maximum area-based rate of net photosynthesis (CO<sub>2</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> per s)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p> We will fit data taken from leaves at the bottom of a tree to this curve today.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="get_estimates">Fit the curve to the data to obtain estimates of Φ, θ, and P<sub>marea</sub></h2>
      <p> <strong><input name="Step 1" type="checkbox">Step 1 - Download <a href="curve_fit_data.xlsx">this</a> file,
          and save it to OneDrive. </strong></p>
      <p>Or wherever you're saving files for this class, that is.</p>
      <p>You'll see that you have two worksheets, one with data from a leaf at the bottom of a tree that has only light
        level (column A, which is Q in the photosynthesis equation) and net photosynthesis (column B, P<sub>net</sub> in
        the photosynthesis equation). The other has data from a leaf at the top of the same tree, which we won't use
        until part 2.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="step2" type="checkbox">Step 2 - Set up the "Bottom" sheet for curve fitting. </strong></p>
      <p><input name="step2a" type="checkbox">In cell A15 type "Parameter", and in B15 type "Values". </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step2b" type="checkbox">Select A16, switch to the "Insert" tab, and click on "Symbol". On the
        Symbol selector that pops up, select "Greek and Coptic" as the "Subset", and find capital <span class="popup">
          Phi<img class="popupimage" src="insert_phi.jpeg"></span> - select it, and click "Insert".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step2c" type="checkbox">Select cell A17 and type "Pmarea". </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step2b" type="checkbox">Select cell A18 and insert lower case <span class="popup">theta<img class="popupimage"
            src="insert_theta.jpeg"></span>, using the "Insert" "Symbol" method you used for Phi. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step2d" type="checkbox">We will need to provide starting values for these parameters, but for
        now just type in 1's for each parameter (1 for B16, B17, and B18).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step2e" type="checkbox">We will be entering the rather complicated equation, above, as a cell
        formula next, so to make this easier we are going to <strong>assign names</strong> to each of the parameters we
        can refer to in the formula. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Click on cell B16 (the Phi parameter), and right-click. </li>
        <li> In the menu that pops up, select "Define name...". </li>
        <li> In the "New name" window that opens, the "Name" will already show the Greek Phi symbol - this looks like it
          would be ideal, but we want to use something that's easy to enter into a cell formula, and don't want to have
          to do to the symbol selector each time we want to use this parameter. Change the Phi symbol to the word "phi",
          change the "Scope" to "Bottom" (that is, just use this name in the Bottom worksheet) and click "OK". </li>
        <li> Now repeat this cell naming process for cell B17 - name B17 "Pmarea".</li>
        <li> Finally, right-click on B18, and name it "theta". </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can now use these descriptive names instead of cell references in our formulas, which will make it easier to
        spot mistakes. Named cells are absolute references, so we won't need to worry about using $ in our formulas
        either.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="step3" type="checkbox">Step 3. Calculate predicted Pnet. </strong></p>
      <p><input name="step3a" type="checkbox">In cell C1 type "Pnet predicted". We will want to enter the formula that
        predicts Pnet in C2, but the equation is pretty hairy - hard to translate into a cell formula, and easy to make
        entry errors while doing it. We can make this easier by breaking the equation down into parts that are easy to
        enter, and then making the final calculation at the end using the parts.</p>
      <p>I've color coded the parts for you here:</p>
      <img src="equation_color_coded.png" alt="Color coded">
      <p>If we have a cell that calculates each of these four color coded parts of the calculation then the final
        calculation will just be:</p>
      <img src="equation_simplified.png" alt="Simplified">
      <p>That's not so hard, right?</p>
      <p>Let's do these one step at a time...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell A27 enter the letter A</li>
        <li>In cell B27 enter the formula that calculates the blue-coded part of the equation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="Excel">=phi*a2+Pmarea</span> - note that since we named phi and Pmarea we can type in the
            names as though they were cell references. The only normal cell reference in the formula is A2, which is
            pointing to the light level (Q) for the first row of data.</li>
          <li>This formula is multiplying phi by 0 and adding Pmarea, which is currently set to 1, so the formula will
            show a 1 if it's entered correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In cell A28 enter the letter B</li>
        <li>In cell B28 enter the formula for the red-coded part of the equation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="Excel">=(phi*a2+Pmarea)^2</span> </li>
          <li>This should also give you a value of 1</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In cell A29 enter the letter C</li>
        <li>In cell B29 enter the formula for the purple-coded part of the equation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="Excel">=4*theta*phi*a2*Pmarea</span></li>
          <li>This one multiplies theta, phi, and Pmarea by the 0 in cell a2, so it will be a value of 0</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In cell A30 enter the letter D</li>
        <li>In cell B30 enter the formula for the green-coded part of the equation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="Excel">=2*theta</span></li>
          <li>Since theta is set to 1 you'll get a 2 here</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Now we can put them all together</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell A31 enter "Full Pnet formula"</li>
        <li>In cell B31 enter the formula that combines A, B, C, and D as they're shown in the simplified equation above</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="Excel">=(b27-sqrt(b28-b29))/b30</span></li>
          <li>This will be equal to 0 if all went well</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Okay, that got us the first Pnet calculated, but we need it for every light level, and we don't want to have to
        do an A, B, C, and D calculation for every row in the data. Now that we have the pieces entered correctly,
        though, we can assemble them into a single cell in C2. The process we'll use is to set each of the A, B, C, and
        D cells into edit mode one at a time, copy the formula inside of them, and then paste them into C2 to assemble
        the full formula in all its glory. The steps you'll complete look like this:</p>
      <img src="assemble_predicted1.gif" alt="First step"></div>
    <div>
      <p>Note that to make the animated image easier to see I'm hiding some rows - row 10 through 13 and row 19 through
        25 are hidden from view, your sheet will have some blank rows showing in those ranges.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The steps are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double-click B27 to set it to edit mode</li>
        <li>Select the contents, including the = sign and copy it (either CTRL+C or right-click and copy)</li>
        <li>VERY IMPORTANT - to avoid changing the cell value click the red X on the left of the formula bar to get out
          of edit mode</li>
        <li>Select cell C2 and paste the formula - it should still point to A2, since copying the text of the formula
          like this doesn't trigger an update to the cell references (selecting the entire cell, copying and pasting it
          elsewhere does make the cell references update, which we don't want here)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now we'll get the B component into the formula - to do this we'll need to copy what we have entered for B, then
        subtract the square root of B from what we just entered for A, like so:</p>
      <img src="assemble_predicted2.gif" alt="Step 2">
      <p>The steps are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double-click B28 to set it to edit mode</li>
        <li>Select everything <em><strong>except the =</strong></em>, and copy it (either CTRL+C or right-click and
          copy)</li>
        <li>Hit the red X to exit editing mode</li>
        <li>Double-click C2 to get it into edit mode</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Since B is inside of a square root, which is being subtracted from A, enter -sqrt( and then paste the B
            formula contents you just copied - close the parentheses for the sqrt() and hit ENTER</li>
          <li>You should still have a 0 in C2</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Next we need to subtract C from B inside of the sqrt():</p>
      <img src="assemble_predicted3.gif" alt="Step 3">
      <p>The steps are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double-click B29 to set it to edit mode</li>
        <li>Select everything except the = and copy it</li>
        <li>Activate C2 for editing, and after the B part of the formula inside of the sqrt() enter a minus sign, -, and
          paste the C part that you just copied (after the 2 you should have a - and then the pasted C part of the
          formula)</li>
        <li>The cell value should still be 0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And finally, we need to divide everything currently in C2 by the D part of the formula</p>
      <img src="assemble_predicted4.gif" alt="Step 4">
      <p>The steps are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double-click on B30 to activate it, and select everything but the = sign</li>
        <li>Copy the selected formula</li>
        <li>Hit the red X</li>
        <li>Activate C2, and after the closing parenthesis for sqrt() enter a division symbol, /, and then paste the
          contents of the D part of the formula that you just copied</li>
        <li>To make sure that we're dividing the entire numerator by the entire denominator, put parentheses around the
          A, B, and C part of the formula (that is , an open parenthesis, (, before the first phi right after = , and a
          closing parenthesis, ), after the sqrt() closing parenthesis), and then also enclose the 2*theta in the
          denominator</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You final formula will look like this:</p>
      <img src="photosynth_excel.png" alt="Formula">
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hopefully you got all the pieces assembled correctly, but make any changes needed to make the cell in C2 match
        this formula. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step3b" type="checkbox">Copy and paste the formula from C2 to the rest of the data rows, C3 to
        C9. The predicted Pnet values should be 1 for the rest of the cells.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="step4" type="checkbox">Step 4. Graph the data. </strong></p>
      <p>At this point we want to pick better starting values for our parameters so that the predicted values come as
        close as we can get them to the observed values before starting Solver - the closer we are to the correct values
        when we start the more likely that Excel will find the correct values for us.</p>
      <p><input name="CheckBox1" type="checkbox">Select cells A1 through C9, and insert a scatter plot with only
        markers. Then, select the predicted Pnet series on the graph, right-click, and select "Format data series" from
        the popup menu. In the "Fill and Line" options (the paint bucket), choose "Solid line" as the line style, and
        then switch to "Marker" and use in "Marker options" use "None" - this will make the predicted values show only
        as a line on the graph.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="step4a" type="checkbox">Add axis labels - use "Light" as the x-axis label, and "Pnet" as the
        y-axis label.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Your graph should look like <span class="popup">this<img class="popupimage" src="fit_bad_start.jpeg"></span>.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Now we can use the graph to help us pick some better starting parameters.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The parameter that sets the level at which the curve plateaus is Pmarea. Look at where the actual Pnet data
            levels off, and set that as the starting value for Pmarea in B17 (3 is good).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Quantum yield (Phi) controls the curvature of the graph. Try values of Phi that increase the curvature, and
            decrease the stair-step appearance of the graph. Start at 0.05.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Theta controls the convexity. Try out values of theta in cell b18 that bring the Pnet predicted values as
            close to the observed Pnet as possible. Start at 0.5.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Once you have the line as close to the data as you can get it, you can move on to the next step.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="step5" type="checkbox">Step 5 - Calculate the sum of squared deviations between Pnet and
          predicted Pnet. </strong></p>
      <p>We can calculate the sum of squared differences between observed Pnet and predicted Pnet in a single cell if we
        use an array formula. In cell B11 type "SumSq", and in cell C11 type the array formula:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="Excel"> =sum((b2:b9-c2:c9)^2)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Don't forget to CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. You should see curly braces around the formula. If you used my suggested
        starting values this will be a small number, 0.206831 (we're starting pretty close to the final solution).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="step6" type="checkbox">Step 6 - Use Solver to find the parameter estimates. </strong></p>
      <p>Turn on the Solver if it isn't already present in the Data tab. Click on Solver, and have it set cell C11 (the
        sum of squared deviations) to Min by changing cells B16:B18 (the parameters). Click "Solve".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> You'll see that the parameters are now a little different than before, and the curve goes nicely through the
        data in the graph.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If you have trouble getting Solver to give you the right solutions bear in mind that these non-linear fits
          are a little fussy... it's really important to start as close to the final solution as possible. Try using
          0.01 for phi and 0.6 for theta and run Solver again.</p>
      </blockquote>
