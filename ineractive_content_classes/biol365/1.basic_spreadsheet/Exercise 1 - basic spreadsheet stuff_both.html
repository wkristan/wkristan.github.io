      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Spreadsheets: the Swiss Army Knives of
        scientific computing</h2>
      <img style="width: 209px; height: 178px; float: left;" alt="Swiss army knife"
        src="swiss-army-knife.jpg">
      <p>Excel is the spreadsheet program produced by Microsoft. Spreadsheets
        are extremely versatile tools for managing, graphing, and analyzing
        data. Nearly anything you would want to do with data can be done with a
        spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are also relatively easy to use, compared to
        other options available.</p>
      <p>However, the versatility of spreadsheets comes at a cost - spreadsheets
        are able to do a little of everything, but they aren't the best at
        anything (have you ever tried to open a can with a Swiss Army knife?
        Brutal). More specialized tools exist that can do each of the things
        that Excel does better than Excel. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Database management - Excel is often used by biologists to manage
          data, but database management programs (such as Microsoft's Access)
          can store larger data sets more efficiently, and better protects
          against errors that can lead to data loss or corruption</li>
        <li>Graphing - biologists often use Excel to make graphs, but there are
          dedicated graphing programs (like SigmaPlot) that can produce a larger
          range of graphs, and can handle plotting of grouped data better than
          Excel does</li>
        <li>Statistical analysis - some biologists do all of their statistical
          analysis in Excel, but there are better statistical analysis programs
          (such as MINITAB, Jamovi, and R) that are faster, support specialized
          types of analysis, and encourage better practices (such as testing of
          statistical assumptions)</li>
        <li>Numerical analysis - Excel can do numerical analysis, in which
          approximate solutions are estimated for problems that lack exact
          analytical solutions, but there are programs (such as MatLab and
          Octave) that are faster and more efficient than Excel for these
          problems</li>
        <li>Simulation modeling - we will use Excel to write a simulation model
          of genetic drift, but there are programming languages (like C++ and
          Python) that would run much faster</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, none of these specialized tools can do all of these functions as
        simply as Excel. Because of its versatility, no matter what you do when
        you leave CSUSM, if your career is at all related to the biological
        sciences you will almost certainly encounter Excel on the job, and it is
        worth your while to learn to use it.</p>
      <p>In this class we will use the version of Excel available in the CSUSM
        computer labs, and on CougarApps, which is Excel 365 for Windows.
        Everything we learn to do will run in older and (presumably) newer
        versions, and on Excel for the Mac, but the exact layout of the
        interface may be different - you can use other versions if you like, but
        be prepared to do some translating of the instructions for the platform
        you're running.</p>
      <h2 id="anatomy_spreadsheet" class="part">Basic anatomy of a worksheet</h2>
      <p>The screen shot below shows part of a blank Excel worksheet - if you
        hover your mouse over the image a tooltip will pop up to identify what
        it is over.</p>
      <div id="worksheetmap"> <a href="#" id="columnIndex" class="tooltip"><span>Column
            index - capital letters</span></a> <a href="#" id="rowIndex" class="tooltip"><span>Row
            index - numbers</span></a> <a href="#" id="cells" class="tooltip"><span>Cells
            - each cell can be referenced by its column index and row index (the
            upper left cell is A1).</span></a> <a href="#" id="formula" class="tooltip"><span>Formula
            bar - the contents of the selected cell can be edited here.</span></a></div>
      <p>In a spreadsheet program like Excel, data is entered into a worksheet,
        that is made up of a grid of <strong>cells</strong> organized in rows
        and columns. You can refer to a cell in the worksheet by its row and
        column index - columns are indexed by letters at the top of each column,
        and rows are indexed by numbers to the left of each row. Cell A1 is
        selected in this screen shot.</p>
      <p>The <strong>formula bar</strong> is the blank area above the columns
        (in the screen shot it starts above column D, and extends to the right
        edge of the image). The selected cell contents will appear and can be
        edited here. As you will see, sometimes what shows in a cell is the
        result of a calculation, and a selected cell's formula will appear in
        the formula bar while the cell itself displays the result of the
        calculation.</p>
      <h2 id="excel_interface" class="part" style="clear: both;">Basic anatomy
        of Excel's interface</h2>
      <p>Much of Excel's functionality can be accessed through its <strong>ribbon
          interface</strong>. This is the name for the grouped sets of buttons
        along the top of the Excel window. Sets of buttons are grouped by type
        of operation, with a label below identifying the button group. Buttons
        are further grouped into named <strong>tabs</strong> by task - the tabs
        are File, Home, Insert, Page Layout, and so on. By default when you
        start Excel the Home tab is selected, and the buttons available in the
        Home tab are shown here: </p>
      <div id="homebuttonmap"> <a href="#" id="clpbd" class="tooltip"><span>Clipboard
            - copy, paste editing tools</span></a> <a href="#" id="font" class="tooltip"><span>Font
            - change font style, color, size</span></a> <a href="#" id="algnmt"
          class="tooltip"><span>Alignment - alignment of cell contents</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="number" class="tooltip"><span>Number - formatting of
            numbers, including style (money, percent) and number of decimals
            displayed</span></a> <a href="#" id="celltools" class="tooltip"><span>Cells
            - inserting, deleting, formating cells</span></a> <a href="#" id="editing"
          class="tooltip"><span>Editing - summing cells, filling a series,
            sorting and filtering</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both">If you move your mouse over this picture the button
        groups that are important to us will pop up a tooltip explaining what
        they are for as you hover over the picture above. The "clipboard" group
        has buttons that handle copying and pasting operations, the "font" group
        has buttons for styling and coloring text, and so on.</p>
      <p>If you click on the next named tab, <strong>Insert</strong>, you'll
        see a different set of buttons.</p>
      <div id="insertbuttonmap"> <a href="#" id="pivot" class="tooltip"><span>Pivot
            tables - insert a pivot table</span></a> <a href="#" id="chart" class="tooltip"><span>Chart
            - insert a new chart</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both;">Buttons on the insert ribbon handle inserting
        (among other things) PivotTables and graphs. We'll use graphs later this
        semester, but today we will focus on PivotTables, which are a powerful
        tool for summarizing data. To make use of PivotTables, we need to use a
        particular data organization called "stacked data". We'll learn what
        that means now.</p>
      <h2 id="data_org" class="part">Data organization</h2>
      <p>Spreadsheets give you a great deal of flexibility in choosing how to
        organize your data. One unfortunate consequence of this flexibility is
        that Excel does not help you select a data organization that is easy to
        analyze. Although any number of ways of entering data are possible they
        are not equally good, and choosing a good data organization makes the
        rest of your work much easier.</p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Bad idea" src="bad_data.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>For example, we will (shortly) be working with some
                measurements made on leaves picked from a tree, and from leaves
                picked up off of the ground. The example to the right shows six
                measurements of masses of leaves in each group, and color is
                used to indicate whether they are taken directly from the tree
                or from the ground.</p>
              <p>Hopefully it is obvious that this example is a particularly bad
                choice for a data organization scheme (in fact, it is probably
                an overstatement to call it an "organization" scheme at all).
                The color coding makes it possible to see which numbers are from
                which group, but trying to do any sort of analysis on these data
                would be difficult at best.</p>
              <p>Hopefully it is clear that this isn't meant to be a realistic
                option for data entry - it just shows you that Excel's
                versatility allows you do whatever you want, even if what you
                want is a terrible idea.</p>

              <p>We can improve on the chaos of the first approach by grouping
                the data together into blocks, grouped by the source of the
                leaves, and ditch the color coding. We can then label the two
                different sets of data in a nearby cell to make it clear what
                each block of data represents. Real scientists use this sort of
                approach, I've seen it in the wild.</p>
              <p>This looks a little bit better - it's certainly less chaotic -
                but think about why it looks better.</p>
              <p>First, having the data values belonging to each group entered
                together in a contiguous block makes it easier to see the values
                all at once, and to compare them. Comparison is a fundamental
                operation in the sciences, and having data organized in a way
                that comparisons between groups can be easily made is always a
                good thing.</p>
              <p>If you wanted to take an average of each group it wouldn't be
                difficult. We will learn more about spreadsheet formulas in a
                couple of weeks, but for now it's enough to know that when we
                calculate something in Excel we need to refer to the cells that
                hold the data, and having them all together in a block makes
                that easy to do.</p>
              <p>But, you may be surprised to find out that this is only <em>
                  slightly</em> better than the chaos method when it comes to
                managing and analyzing data.</p>
              <p>The disadvantage of this method is that it doesn't make good
                use of the rows and columns to help us organize the data. As you
                learned in biostats, scientists collect data by defining <strong>variables</strong>
                as measurements of specific properties of some component of a
                system we're studying. We also need to replicate our
                measurements, which means that we use more than one experimental
                <strong>subject</strong> (i.e. the individual we are measuring),
                and measure the variables we are using on each subject. When we
                have data from a variable that we want to enter into a
                worksheet, we can make use of the rows and columns to help us
                keep track of what variable the data represents, and what
                individual subject the data pertains to.<br>
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Unstacked data" src="unstacked.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>A better alternative to entering the data in blocks is to use
                an <strong>unstacked</strong> organization, shown to the right.
                In this organization a column is used to hold all of the data
                from leaves on the ground, and another is used for all of the
                data from leaves on the tree. You can see that the columns are
                labeled, and the labels identify two different groups - the
                first group is the leaves on the ground, the second is leaves
                picked from the tree. The column labels also indicate that these
                are mass measurements.</p>
              <p>This is one of the two common organizations used for
                statistical data analysis - you might recognize it from
                biostats, because it was one of the two data organization types
                that were supported by MINITAB or Jamovi. It isn't the one that
                I recommend, though, unless you're forced to use it (a few
                functions in MINITAB require it, for example).</p>
              <p>The primary problem with unstacked data is that while it uses
                columns to indicate the group leaves belong to, the rows don't
                carry any meaning. For example, the first row of data (in row 2
                of the worksheet) has a 0.4 for the mass of the first leaf from
                the ground, and 4 for the first leaf from a tree, but there is
                no reason for these two measurements to be sitting next to each
                other, they just happen to be the first number entered for each
                group - we could rearrange the numbers in column A while leaving
                the values in column B alone, and it wouldn't matter.
                Consequently, the fact that these two leaves are in the same row
                tells us nothing useful. Worse, it <em>seems</em> like it might
                tell us something useful - if they're in the same row we might <em>think</em>
                that they're paired in some way - and we can't tell by just
                looking at the data if changing the order in one set of
                measurements and not the other would be a problem. This may not
                seem like a problem if you're working with your own data and
                have a reasonably good memory, but if you're working with other
                people's data it can be a problem.</p>
              <p>Another limitation of this approach is that it doesn't extend
                well to additional variables - we may have multiple pieces of
                information that we want to record about each leaf, and if we
                have data on the mass of each leaf, the thickness of the leaf,
                the maximum width of the leaf, and so on, there's no simple way
                to add these additional pieces of information that makes it
                clear which measurements are from the same leaf.</p>
            </td>

            <td><img alt="Stacked data" src="stacked_data.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>The best, most flexible organization (and thus the one I
                recommend) is <strong>stacked</strong> data. You can see an
                example of stacked data to the right - now each column is a
                different variable (with mass in column A, and the leaf type,
                which is either tree or ground, in column G), and each row is a
                single leaf. Both the row and column carries information now -
                the row identifies which leaf the measurement is from, and the
                column identifies the measurement's variable. This organization
                also encourages thinking in terms of variables - rather than
                thinking of ground and tree as two different groups to compare,
                this approach encourages you to think of the location of the
                leaf as the categorical variable "type", with levels T (picked
                from the tree) and G (taken from the ground). Statistical
                analysis is based on measuring the relationships between
                variables, and this type of organization helps you think in
                those terms.</p>
              <p>One of the huge advantages of stacked data is that it makes
                analysis of data much easier, in Excel as well as in other
                programs. For example, when data sets are organized this way
                it's possible to take advantage of Excel's data analysis
                features like sorting, filtering, and (most importantly)
                PivotTables.</p>

      <p id="entering_data" class="part">The take-home message is this: Excel's
        versatility is a great advantage, but it also enables bad habits. You
        collect data so that you can analyze it, eventually if not immediately,
        and it is best to pick a data organization that makes analysis easy. I
        recommend using stacked data so that the analysis steps will be as easy
        as possible.</p>
      <h2 id="enter_extract" class="part">Exercise - entering data, extracting
        data, re-arranging data, summarizing data in Excel.</h2>
      <p>Before you get started, create a folder called "biol365" at the root of
        your OneDrive folder. Within that folder, create a folder called "ex1".
        It's very important that you set this up correctly to make sure the
        instructions for these exercises work for you. By using OneDrive your
        files will be automatically backed up, and will be available for you to
        use from any computer on campus, or even from home whether you use
        CougarApps or a locally-installed version of Excel.</p>
      <p>Download this file, called "<a href="leaf_data.xlsx">leaf_data.xlsx</a>",
        to your OneDrive (in folder biol365/ex1). The file contains measurements
        of several variables from 103 sycamore leaves that were either collected
        from the ground, or picked live from a tree.</p>
      <p>If you open the file in Excel, you'll see that it is organized as
        stacked data. Each row is a single leaf, and each column is a variable.
        The names of the variables are mass, petiole.diam (diameter of the
        petiole in mm - the petiole is the small stem that attaches the leaf to
        the branch), max.vein.len (length of the longest vein in mm), num.veins
        (a count of the number of veins in the leaf), leaf.thick (thickess of
        the leaf in mm), max.width (width of the leaf at its widest point, in
        mm), and type (T for leaves picked from the tree, and G for leaves
        collected from the ground).</p>
      <p> As you work through the exercise, bear in mind that <strong>undo is
          your friend</strong>! The left-curved arrow,<img alt="Undo" src="undo.png">,
        at the upper left corner of the window is the "undo" button (the
        right-curved arrow is the "redo" button). If you make a mistake (such as
        deleting something you didn't mean to, or sorting something incorrectly)
        you can click the undo button and most of the time you can reverse your
        mistake. Clicking the button will undo the most recent operation, and
        clicking repeatedly will undo in the order that you executed the
        operations. Clicking and dropping down the undo list allows you to
        select a particular operation to undo, out of order. </p>
      <h3 id="filtering" class="part">A. Filtering and extracting data</h3>
      <p>We are going to start today by learning some of Excel's features that
        help you enter and manipulate data. We'll start with filtering.</p>

        "mass" in cell A1), and click and hold "Sort &amp; Filter" on the right
        side of the button bar - when the menu drops down select "Filter" (<span
          class="popup">like this<img class="popupimage" src="filter.png"></span>).
        You'll see that activating filtering puts a drop-down menu button on
        each of the column headings in the data set. As long as all the data are
        contiguous (meaning, no blank rows or columns) Excel will find all the
        variables and turn filtering on for all of them. </p>

        column are identified (which are all either T or G), with a check box
        next to each of them. Un-check the box next to G, so that only T is
        selected, and click "OK". You'll see that only the T leaves are showing.
        To help you remember that you're filtering the data, the icon in the
        drop-down menu box has changed to show a filter icon, and the row
        numbers have turned blue and are no longer sequential numbers - they
        still represent the row numbers from the entire data set, but the rows
        with G leaves are hidden.</p>
      <p>This is just a temporary change in how the data are displayed, and
        everything will be back to normal when you turn filtering off. If you
        want to extract the data for T into a new data set, you can select all
        the cells, copy, and paste to a new worksheet. To do this, you will need
        to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select all the cells including the column names (see below if you
          don't know what I mean by this), right-click in the selected cells
          (that is, click the right mouse button), and select "Copy".</li>
        <li>Make a new worksheet by clicking on the + next to the "Sheet1" tab
          at the bottom of the worksheet - it will be called Sheet2.</li>
        <li>Select the upper-left cell of Sheet2 you want to paste to (A1),
          right-click and select "Paste". You now have the leaves from the trees
          permanently duplicated into a sheet by themselves.</li>

        <h3>Selecting cells vs. editing cells</h3>
        <p>This is a good time to double-check that you know what it means to
          "select" a cell in Excel. <strong>Selecting</strong> a cell is done
          by clicking once, with the left mouse button. A selected cell looks
          like this:</p>
        <p><img alt="Selected cell" src="selecting_cell_selected.png"></p>
        <p>A selected cell has a thick line around it, with a small square in
          the lower right called the "fill handle" (which we will make use of
          shortly), but the "cursor" (i.e. the vertical line that shows where
          anything you type on the keyboard will appear) is not there.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the mouse you use only has one button, and if so it acts
          like a left button on a two-button scroll wheel mouse like the ones we
          have in the computer labs. Left-clicking is much more common an
          operation than right-clicking, so if the instructions only say "click"
          assume they mean "left click".</p>
        <p>If you double-click on a cell, it changes its appearance to this:</p>
        <p><img alt="Activated" src="selecting_cell_activated.png"></p>
        <p>Hopefully you can see that double-clicking changes the appearance of
          the cell, and adds a cursor (the thin, blinking vertical line on the
          left of the cell) - this indicates that the cell is activated for <strong>editing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>You don't need to double-click an empty cell to enter data into it,
          you can just select it and start typing. However, if a cell already
          contains something that you want to change you need to double-click to
          edit its contents - if you don't switch to editing mode before you
          start typing you will replace what is already in the cell with
          whatever you type in. </p>
        <p>If you meant to select a cell but accidentally enter editing mode
          instead, you can get out of it by hitting the ENTER key if you haven't
          made any changes yet, or by hitting the "ESC" key or by clicking on
          the red X next to the formula bar, <img alt="Cancel" src="cancel_button.png">,
          if you accidentally made a change and don't want it saved in the cell
          (it doesn't turn red until you hover over it). If you've already hit
          ENTER you can use undo instead.</p>
        <p>To select more than one cell you can left click to select a single
          cell, hold down your mouse button, and drag to select multiple cells.
          This works best if you select one corner of the range you want,
          click/hold/drag to the other corner and release - this will shade the
          selected cells gray, and put a border around them. Alternatively, you
          can select the cell in one corner of the range, move to the other
          corner with your mouse wheel or by clicking in the sliders on the left
          and bottom of the worksheet window, and then hold down the SHIFT key
          while clicking on the other corner cell - this will select everything
          between the first and second selected cells.</p>
        <h3>Context and pointer types</h3>
        <p>Excel has a huge set of features, and to avoid being overwhelming it
          tries to only present things to you that it thinks you need at the
          moment. That is, the tools that Excel presents to you depends on the <strong>context</strong>.
          We will see this frequently throughout the semester - you will see
          different options when you right-click on a cell in your worksheet
          than when you right-click in a graph (the menu that pops up is even
          called a "context menu"), and the tabs in the ribbon interface will
          change when you select a cell, a PivotTable, or a graph.</p>
        <p>The other thing that depends on context is the <strong>pointer type</strong>.
          When you are moving your mouse around over the ribbon, or anywhere
          outside of the worksheet cells, the pointer will look like this:<img alt="Ribbon pointer"
            src="pointer_type_ribbon.png"> - this pointer is used to select menu
          items, or to click on buttons in the ribbon.</p>
        <p>When you move your pointer over the cells in the worksheet, it
          changes to this:<img alt="Select" src="pointer_type_select.png"> -
          this pointer is used to select a cell (with a single click) or
          activate it for editing (with a double-click).</p>
        <p>If you hover over the thick line around a highlighted cell (anywhere
          but the fill handle) the pointer changes to this: <img alt="Cell border"
            src="pointer_type_cell_border.png"> - this pointer can be used to
          move a cell to another position in the worksheet. If you click, hold,
          and drag with the left mouse button on the edge of a cell or a range
          of cells when this pointer type the selected cells will be moved to
          the location where you release the button.</p>
        <p>Last for now, if you hover over the little black square in the lower
          right corner of the cell (the fill handle) the pointer looks like
          this: <img alt="Fill" src="pointer_type_fill.png"> - with this
          pointer, if you click/hold/drag the fill handle you can either
          duplicate the contents into the cells you drag over, or you create a
          series into the cells you drag over, depending on the cell's contents.</p>

      <p><input name="checkbox3" type="checkbox">3. <strong>Filtering by
          numeric values</strong>. Switch back to the full data set in Sheet
        1.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We can filter numeric variables based on their values - for example, if
        we wanted to look at the leaves with large petiole diameters we can
        filter the petiole diameter column so that only leaves with petiole
        diameters bigger than 3 are shown. If you drop down the filter menu for
        petiole diameter, you'll see that you get the same type of list of
        unique numbers that you got for the type column, sorted in numeric
        order. You could un-select any that are less than 3, but as the data set
        gets large and the number of different values increases this approach
        becomes impractical.</p>
      <p>A better way is to select "Number filters" â†’ "Greater than or equal
        to", and enter 3 for the value. Since the leaf type filter is still in
        place, you are now seeing the T leaves with petiole diameters greater
        than or equal to 3.</p>
      <p>Copy the data, make a new sheet (Sheet3), and paste the data there.</p>
      <p>Switch back to Sheet1, make sure you have only a single cell selected
        (anywhere in the worksheet is fine) and turn off filtering by selecting
        "Sort &amp; Filter" and clicking on "Filter" again - this is a toggle,
        meaning that selecting it when it's off turns filtering on, and
        selecting when it's on turns filtering off. With filtering turned off
        all the data are displayed, in the original order.</p>
      <h3 id="fill-handle" class="part">B. Proper use of the "fill handle" and
        the "fill" menu.</h3>
      <p>Now we are going to sequentially number the leaves in each group, which
        will help us when we re-organize the data in the next step.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox4" type="checkbox">4. <strong>Prepare yourself to
          sort by type</strong>. We want to sort by leaf type so that we can
        easily number the leaves within each group. But before we do this you
        should know that...</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> SORTING A SPREADSHEET IS DANGEROUS</span></p>
        <p>Another problem with Excel's flexibility in data entry is that you
          have the ability to make big, costly mistakes with little or no
          effort.</p>
        <p>One of the quickest ways to irretrievably screw up your entire data
          set in Excel is to sort it incorrectly. For example, rows represent
          measurements from a single leaf, and if you sorted the leaf
          thicknesses without sorting the rest of the columns the thicknesses
          would no longer be associated with the correct leaf, you would
          scramble the data. If you didn't realize you did this, saved your
          work, and closed Excel, all "undo" information is lost and you would
          be unable to recover the original sort order. Worse yet, mistakes like
          this can be very difficult to detect - it doesn't change the data
          values, just the relationships between the variables - so you may
          never realize your data are all wrong.</p>
        <p>Excel knows this is a danger, and tries to help you - if you select
          part of a contiguous set of data and try to sort it, Excel will pop up
          a warning and ask if you want to extend the selection to include all
          of the contiguous data. You can take advantage of this to speed up
          your work - if you select just a single cell in a contiguous block,
          Excel assumes you want to sort the entire contiguous data set and will
          select it for you. But, if there is a blank column in the middle of a
          data set it does not assume that the columns to the right of the blank
          are meant to be sorted with the columns to the left of the blank, and
          it will not extend the sort to include them, or even warn you of
          danger.</p>
        <p>So, to avoid problems, make sure your data are contiguous - no blank
          columns unless you want the different data sets to be treated as
          unconnected for some reason. The data we are working with is
          contiguous, so we won't have a problem with the leaves data, but
          you've been warned!</p>
        <p>The other sort problem we have to be careful about is that unless we
          have a column that indicates the original sort order we won't be able
          to get back to the original order after we save and quit. Sometimes
          the original order of the data is important - the data may have been
          collected over time, for example, and it may be important to know the
          order that the data were observed. We will start by adding an
          "original order" column that shows how the data were sorted when we
          opened the worksheet - no matter how we sort the data, we can always
          get it back to the original sort order by sorting on this column.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><input name="checkbox5" type="checkbox">5. <strong>Make an "original
          order" column for safety, using the fill handle</strong>. Enter
        "Original order" in column H1 (note that I used periods to separate the
        words in the other columns, because the data were meant to be imported
        for analysis into a program called R that punishes you for having spaces
        in names - Excel does not punish you, so we can use a space in the
        Original order column name).</p>
      <p>In cell H2 enter a 1. After you hit ENTER you will be in cell H3, so
        select H2 again. </p>
      <p>We're going to use the fill handle to make our number sequence,&nbsp;<img
          alt="Fill handle" src="fill_handle.png">&nbsp; - the fill handle is a
        little confusing to use, because it does different things in different
        contexts. If you left-click, hold, and drag the handle down it acts as a
        copy/paste (go ahead and try this - fill down a few cells and you'll see
        you have 1's in each cell you filled into).</p>
      <p>If you change the entry in H2 to "Leaf 1" (without the quotes) and then
        use the fill handle to extend it to the cells below you'll get the
        sequency Leaf 1, Leaf 2, Leaf 3, etc. - Excel assumes that mixes of
        letters and numbers are meant to be unique labels, and it increases the
        number by one for each cell you extend the sequence into.</p>
      <p>Now, change the number in H2 back to 1, and enter a 2 in H3, and delete
        any Leaf X labels left from the previous step. Select both cells H2 and
        H3,<img alt="Extend" src="extend_series.png">. If you now double-click
        on the fill handle you will see that you now have sequential numbers
        from 1 to 103 in column H, indicating the current (original) sort order.
        Excel interpreted the two cells you selected as the start of a numerical
        sequence and it extended the sequence to the last row of data in the
        adjacent column G.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox6" type="checkbox">6. <strong>Sort by leaf type</strong>.
        To sort by type, select cell G1, drop down "Sort &amp; Filter", and
        select "Sort A to Z" (that is, alphabetically, or in increasing numeric
        order). If you watch as this happens, you'll see that Excel very quickly
        expands the selection to the entire data set, and sorts the entire data
        set by leaf type - the rows are all intact, they are just ordered by
        type.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox7" type="checkbox">7. <strong>Enter sequential
          leaf numbers within each type, using "fill series"</strong>. Enter the
        column heading "leaf.number" into cell I1.</p>
      <p>We could use the same trick as we used before, but sometimes it's
        inconvenient to use the fill handle (if there are thousands of rows, for
        example). In this case we want to be able to number the leaves
        sequentially for each group from 1 to n, where n is the number of leaves
        in a group. We can create sequential numbering for a whole set of
        selected rows, which will work better for this task.</p>
      <p>Enter a 1 in cell I2, and then select all the cells from I2 to I53
        (which are the rows that have G leaves - that's a capital i in I53, not
        a 1).</p>
      <p>Next, select "Fill" â†’ "Series" from the ribbon - it's just to the left
        of Sort&amp;Filter and it's labeled "Fill" if you have Excel at full
        screen. If not, it will look like this: <img alt="Fill series" src="fill_series.png">.
      </p>
      <p>In the window that pops up, the default settings of a "Linear" type,
        with a "Step value" of 1 will give us sequential numbers, so click "OK".</p>
      <p>Repeat this for T leaves (enter a 1 in cell I54, and fill the series to
        the last row).</p>
      <p><input name="box8a" type="checkbox">8. <strong>Sort the columns from
          left to right alphabetically</strong>. We don't really need to do
        this, but just so you know how...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click into a cell in the data set (anywhere with data in it), and
          then click on "Sort &amp; Filter" â†’ "Custom sort". In the dialog that
          pops up, you'll see that you can select a "Sort by" column, and then
          can "Sort On" either the data values in the cells (the default), or by
          formatting information. Excel's default assumption is that you want to
          sort rows, so these options are all selected to allow you to pick
          column labels. We don't want to sort rows this time, so ignore all
          these settings for the moment.</li>
        <li>Click on "Options" and select "Sort left to right", and then "OK".</li>
        <li>Now, back in the Sort settings everything is set up for sorting
          columns based on the values in one or more row. To sort the columns
          alphabetically by column label:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Select "Row 1" for the "Sort by" selection, and leave the rest at
            default values.</li>
          <li>Click "OK". </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll see that the columns are in alphabetical order.</p>

      <h3 id="pivotTable" class="part">C. Using Pivot Tables to summarize your
        data.</h3>
      <p>Excel's PivotTable is a tool for summarizing stacked data sets. Once
        you learn how they work, you'll see that PivotTables are an easy,
        convenient way to summarize complex data sets.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox8" type="checkbox">9. <strong>Construct a Pivot
          Table</strong>. We will use Pivot Tables today to calculate the sample
        size, average, and standard deviation of mass for each leaf type.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox9" type="checkbox">a. Make sure you're in Sheet1,
        and select any cell in the block of data, activate the "Insert" tab, and
        click on PivotTable ( <span class="popup">like this<img class="popupimage"
            src="pivot_table1.jpeg"></span>).</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox10" type="checkbox">b. You will see the Create
        PivotTable dialog <span class="popup">pop up<img class="popupimage" src="pivot_table2.jpeg"></span>,
        and you will see that it has successfully found your data and identified
        it in "Table/Range:". The format of this entry is Sheet1!$A$1:$I$104.
        This is saying that the data are in Sheet 1, with the upper left cell
        found in cell A1, and the lower right cell found in I104. We will learn
        about the meaning of the dollar signs later this semester, but for now
        ignore them - they don't change the fact that the cell references are A1
        and I104. If you look at the data still visible behind the Create Pivot
        Table window, there is a dotted line around the data that indicates what
        the Pivot Table will be using.</p>
      <p>Having found the data you wish to summarize, you now need to decide
        where to put the summary table - by default Excel elects to <strong>create
          a new worksheet</strong>, which is what you want here. Select "OK" to
        create the table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox11" type="checkbox">c. Now you can construct the
        table. You should be looking at a new worksheet (Sheet4), with a <span
          class="popup">blank template<img class="popupimage" src="pivot_table3.jpeg"></span>
        for your table to the left, a list of the column names in your data
        range to the <span class="popup">upper right<img class="popupimage" src="pivot_table4.jpeg"></span>
        (called "fields"), and a set of possible places to place the variables
        in the table in the <span class="popup">lower right<img class="popupimage"
            src="pivot_table5.jpeg"></span>.</p>
      <p> The simplest way to construct the table is to drag the names of the
        variables you wish to use from the Field List into the blank template -
        in computer science a "field" is a column in a table, so the PivotTable
        Fields list is a listing of all the columns in your data set. The
        variable "<strong>type</strong>" is your grouping variable, so drag it
        from the field list and drop it into the "Columns<strong></strong>" box
        below the field list. You will see that the two leaf types present in
        the data are now showing as column labels (T and G). </p>
      <p>You wish to calculate mean and standard deviation of mass, so select "<strong>mass</strong>"
        and drag it to the "<strong>Values</strong>" box, just below the
        "Columns" box you just used. You will now have summarized data, and by
        default Excel picks a sum as the statistic to report for numeric data.
        It looks like this:</p>
      <img alt="Sums" src="first_pivot_table_sum.png">
      <p>The layout is fine, but the statistic is wrong, so double-click on "Sum
        of mass" in the table and change "Sum" to "Average". It will now look
        like this:</p>
      <img alt="Averages" src="first_pivot_table_average.png">
      <p>You'll see a funny quirk of Excel pivot tables at this point - the
        statistic for the overall data is still labeled "Grand Total", even
        though it is no longer a total. I'm not sure why Excel does this, but it
        has survived multiple updates to the software, so it seems we're stuck
        with it. Just recognize that the statistic in the margins of the table
        is the same as in the body of the table, no matter what the label says
        it is.</p>
      <p>Now we will add a standard deviation. Drag "mass" from the list of
        fields into the Values box for a second time. You will see that Sum of
        mass is now sitting next to Average of mass beneath each leaf type
        label. Double-click "Sum of mass" and change "Sum" to "StdDev" (not
        StdDevp, which is the population standard deviation - you will probably
        never use this option, as you will always be dealing with samples of
        data).</p>
      <p>When you dropped mass into the value fields box for the second time,
        you may have noticed that the "Columns" block gained an item called Î£
        Values. You can drag Î£ Values between the columns and rows blocks to
        change the layout - when it's in the Rows box each statistic is in a
        different row, and if it's in the Columns box each statistic is in a
        separate column beneath its corresponding leaf type. With the leaf types
        acting as column groupings the table is much easier to read if you put
        the statistics in rows - drag Î£ Values into the Rows box.</p>
      <p>We'll add a sample size into our table now - drag mass from the fields
        list into the Î£ Values box and change this third mass entry to be a
        count. We'll do this a little differently this time - if you click on
        "Sum of mass" in "Î£ Values" (the entry for your third mass entry), and
        select "Value field settings" from the drop-down menu you will be taken
        to the "Value Field Settings" window again, and there you can change the
        summary statistic to a count - this gives you your sample size.</p>
      <p>At this point, you should have a table with a column called Data that
        gives average, stdev, and count of mass as labels, a column with G as
        the type, a column with T as the type, and a column called Grand Total
        that gives the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for all leaves.</p>
      <p> <input name="checkbox12" type="checkbox">10. <strong>Change the
          arrangement of the table</strong>. We would like to swap the row and
        column labels next - that is, we want the Types to be row labels, and to
        have a different summary statistic in each column. There are two
        different ways to do this.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><input name="checkbox13" type="checkbox"> a. Method 1 - you can use
        Paste Special to transpose the table. Select the table from the upper
        left to the lower right edges (from cell A3 to cell D7), position your
        pointer someplace over the selected cells, and right-click. From the
        menu that pops up select "Copy". Select cell A14, right-click and select
        "Paste special" â†’ "Paste special" (the second one is at the very bottom
        of the popup menu). You will get a <span class="popup">Paste Special
          dialog<img class="popupimage" src="paste_special.jpeg"></span> that
        allows you to do several possible things with the data you selected when
        you paste it. From the "Paste" area, change from "All" to "Values"; this
        will just paste the numbers and letters, but will omit formatting and
        any cell formulas that may mess up the resulting table. Finally, click
        on "Transpose" (which is in the lower-right of the dialog), which means
        to swap the rows and columns. Click "OK". You'll see that your table has
        the same data values as before, but now the types are row labels, and
        the summary labels are in the columns.</p>
      <p>This method works fine, but the pasted cells are no longer a pivot
        table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox14" type="checkbox">b. Method 2 - you can
        re-arrange the pivot table structure. Select a cell inside the table to
        activate the PivotTable editing tools again. Now, in the lower right
        boxes you can drag "Î£ Values" from Rows to Columns, and "type" from
        Columns to Rows. This should give you the table you want, with types as
        row labels and summary types as column labels. Note that if you try to
        do this in reverse order, with type moved first, you end up with a table
        that is long enough to overlap with your transposed table in A14 to E17,
        and Excel gives you a warning and asks you to confirm that's what you
        want to do. Dragging "Î£ Values" into the columns first makes the table
        wider than it will be in the end, which doesn't overwrite anything.</p>
      <p>We won't be using the "Filters" option today, but it does what you
        might expect from our filtering exercise, above - if you were to drop
        the leaf type variable into the "Filters" area, you could use that to
        show just one leaf type or the other in the pivot table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox20" type="checkbox">11. <strong>Un-stack the data</strong>.
        The reason we sequentially numbered the leaves in Sheet1 was to make it
        easy to un-stack one of the columns of data into a column for each leaf
        type using a Pivot Table. Although I want you to use stacked data
        whenever possible, there are times that you might need the data in an
        un-stacked arrangement (there are some statistical tests in MINITAB that
        require un-stacked data, for example).</p>
      <p>To un-stack a column, switch back to Sheet1 and insert a new Pivot
        Table (make a new one instead of changing the one you've already made,
        we're not done with it yet), and then use leaf.number as the Rows, and
        type as the Columns. We now just need to put whatever variable we want
        to un-stack into Values - drag mass into the Values, and you will see a
        column for G leaves and a column for T leaves of masses. Excel tells you
        it is using the "Sum of mass", but since each row has a unique leaf
        number within each leaf type the "sums" under the G and T columns are
        actually just data values.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="blanksZeros">Blanks and zeros</h3>
      <p>Spreadsheets make a distinction between missing values and measured
        zeros. A measured zero is an actual data value that was observed to be
        equal to zero. A missing value is a data point with an unknown value
        (because it was never measured, equipment failed, a computer crashed, or
        whatever), and since we don't know what number it should be we shouldn't
        assume it was a zero.</p>
      <p>We can see how Excel makes a distinction between the two very easily,
        because the pivot table is linked to the leaf data set. If we change a
        data value, we just need to update the pivot table and the calculated
        values will update as well.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox22" type="checkbox">12. <strong>Change a data
          value to zero, and update the pivot table</strong>. We will now change
        a data value in Sheet1 to a 0 and see what it does to the summary
        statistics in the PivotTable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the data in Sheet1. </li>
        <li>Sort on the original order to get the data back to its original sort
          order.</li>
        <li>Change the mass in the first row&nbsp;from 4 to 0 (after sorting
          from left to right it should be in column C)</li>
        <li>Switch to the pivot table we used to calculate means, standard
          deviations, and sample sizes for mass. Right-click a cell within the
          table, and select "Refresh", and as you do so watch how the numbers in
          the table change. Since you changed one of the tree leaf masses to 0
          the average and standard deviation for leaf should change. Sample size
          doesn't change, however, because the 0 is considered a measured value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><input name="checkbox23" type="checkbox">13. <strong>Delete a data
          value and update the pivot table</strong>. Now we will see how things
        change when we delete the data value in Sheet1 instead of setting it to
        0.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the data in Sheet1 and delete the 0 you entered (use
          either backspace or delete - these are not the same in Excel, but
          either will work here). </li>
        <li>Now, back to the pivot table, and refresh again. Since a data value
          is missing the average, standard deviation, and the sample size all
          change. The average should change less than when the value was set to
          0, because the 0 mass was an incorrect value that dragged the average
          down, whereas the blank is a missing value that has no effect on the
          calculation. The sample size new reflects that the blank is omitted,
          and should be 50 instead of 51 for the leaves picked from trees.</li>
