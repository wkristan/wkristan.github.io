          style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">Next, we will use the bootstrap approach to test whether moths can
        remember things that they learned as caterpillars. This example is taken from lecture notes developed by Dolph
        Schluter at the University of British Columbia, which in turn were based on an experiment by Blackiston et al.
        (2008, PLoS One 3: e1736).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> As you no doubt aware, moths and butterflies begin life as caterpillars, which look nothing like moths and
        butterflies. Caterpillars become adult moths through a process called "metamorphosis". The changes in body
        architecture during metamorphosis are dramatic, to the point that many caterpillar tissues un-differentiate, and
        then re-differentiate into different tissues as adults. It's possible that the brain tissue also undergoes a
        substantial re-formation, but if this is the case any learning that took place as a caterpillar should be lost
        as an adult.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Blackiston and colleagues wanted to see whether the things caterpillars learn before they go through
        metamorphosis are remembered after metamorphosis by adult moths. To test this, they conditioned a group of
        tomato hornworm (<span style="font-style: italic;">Manduca sexta</span>) caterpillars to avoid the smell of
        ethyl acetate (EA) by stimulating them with a mild electrical shock when they were exposed to the chemical.
        These caterpillars developed an aversion to the smell, and after conditioning they would consistently crawl away
        when EA was presented without needing to be shocked. Another group of caterpillars used as controls were exposed
        to EA but were not shocked, and thus did not develop an aversion to the smell. </p>
      <p>After each set of caterpillars underwent metamorphosis to adults, they were tested for aversion to the smell of
        EA by putting them in a chamber with clean air piped into one side, and EA infused air piped into the other. The
        direction they moved was an indication of whether they avoided EA. The summarized data are here:</p>
      <p>Table 1. Responses to EA air by adults trained as caterpillars to avoid EA, compared with untrained controls.</p>

      <p> To test whether there is a difference in selection of air types by trained or control animals, we will
        bootstrap the <strong>odds ratio</strong> for of choosing clean air over EA air for each treatment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Odds</span>
        are ratios of the probability of an event occurring divided by the probability of an event not occurring. So, in
        this case, the odds of choosing clean air for trained caterpillars would be: </p>
      <p>(32/41)/(9/41), or 32/9 = 3.55. </p>
      <p>This tells us that an EA trained caterpillar has a 3.55 times greater probability of avoiding EA than choosing
        EA air as an adult. Note that the denominator is the same for both the probability of EA air and clean air, so
        the denominator cancels - you can calculate the odds as 32/9 = 3.55. </p>
      <p>For controls the odds are 25/21 = 1.19 - the probability of choosing EA air is only 1.19 times as big as
        choosing clean air. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> An <span style="font-weight: bold;">odds ratio</span> is the ratio of odds for one group divided by odds for
        another group. The odds ratio for trained to control caterpillars would then be (32/9) / (25/21) = 2.99. This
        means that the odds that a trained caterpillar will choose clean air is 2.99 times as large as the odds that a
        control caterpillar will choose clean air. If trained caterpillars and controls behaved in exactly the same way
        the odds ratio would be 1. </p>
      <p>We now want to know whether the observed odds ratio of 2.99 is significantly different from 1. Although the
        researchers conducted the experiment 89 times the individual observations are categorical - they either moved
        toward EA air or toward clean air, but we don't have any individual numeric measurements from which we can
        calculate means or standard deviations.</p>
      <p>We can assess whether the observed odds ratio of 2.99 indicates that trained caterpillars remember their
        training as adults by bootstrapping a confidence interval for it, and if the interval includes 1 then we can't
        be certain that the odds are different for trained and control caterpillars. If the interval doesn't include 1,
        then we have evidence that the odds of avoiding EA air are higher for moths that were trained to avoid EA air as
        caterpillars, and thus that moths are remembering what they learned as caterpillars.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> <input name="cb1a" type="checkbox">Step 1. Open the Excel spreadsheet, and switch to sheet
          "MothLearning". </strong></p>
      <p>You'll see three columns, the first giving an ID number for the moth, the second identifying the treatment type
        (trained to avoid EA or control), and the third identifying the adult response (clean air or EA air). Each row
        is the result for a single moth. The table above was generated from data like this.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb2a" type="checkbox"> Step 2. Generate random numbers. </strong></p>
      <p>In cell D1 type "Random numbers", and in cell D2 write a formula that generates integer numbers between 1 and
        41. Copy and paste this formula JUST to cells D2 through D42 - these will be used to select bootstrap samples
        for the trained group only.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Next, in cell D43, write another formula that selects numbers between 42 and 87. These will be used to select
        a bootstrap sample from the control animals only. Copy and paste the function to cells D44 through D88.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb3a" type="checkbox">Step 3. Select the bootstrap sample. </strong></p>
      <p>In cell E1 type "Bootstrap sample", and in E2 use the "lookup" function to select a sample from the trained
        moths. The formula will be:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="Excel"> =lookup(d2,a$2:a$88, c$2:c$88)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Copy this and paste it through cell E88. This formula takes the moth ID randomly selected in column D and
        selected the adult response associated with it. Since you're generating the random numbers separately for
        trained and control animals, we can use just one lookup() function, and we can let the random number formulas
        take care of sampling from the right group.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb4a" type="checkbox"> Step 4. Set up a pivot table to calculate the frequencies.</strong></p>
      <p>Insert a pivot table into the MothLearning sheet (rather than in its own sheet), in cell H1.</p>
      <p>For the Pivot Table, use Adult Responses as the rows and Treatments as the columns. Use adult responses as the
        Values (use "count" as the statistic).</p>
      <p>The pivot table will look the same as the table above, with the same numbers in each cell of the table.</p>
      <p>You'll need to refer to the PivotTable by name when you write your macro - if things went smoothly it's called
        PivotTable1, but you can confirm this by selecting a cell within the PivotTable, switching to the PivotTable
        Analyze tab, and then dropping down the PivotTable menu on the left side - it will show the name of the
        currently selected table as the PivotTable Name.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb5a" type="checkbox"> Step 5. Calculate the odds ratio. </strong></p>
      <p>The odds of an event is the probability the event will occur divided by the probability that it will not occur.
        In cell H8 type "Odds of choosing clean air", and in I8 type:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="Excel"> =i3/i4</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> This first calculation gives the odds of selecting clean air for the controls. Copy and paste to J8 to get the
        odds of selecting clean air for the trained moths.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Now, to calculate the ratio of these odds, in cell I10 type:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="Excel"> =j8/i8</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> and type the label "Odds ratio" in cell H10. The value should be 2.99, which is our observed experimental
        result. </p>
      <p>Copy it and paste-special the observed odds ratio's value to I12, and label it "Observed odds ratio" in H12.</p>
      <p>Type "Lower" and "Upper" into cells H13 and H14, respectively - we will be putting the lower and upper limits
        of the confidence intervals into I13 and I14 when we write the macro.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb6a" type="checkbox"> Step 6. Modify the pivot table to use the bootstrap samples. </strong></p>
      <p>Replace "Adult responses" with "Bootstrap sample" in both the row labels and Values of your pivot table. The
        odds ratio in cell I10 now reflects the bootstrap sample counts rather than the actual data counts.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb7a" type="checkbox"> Step 7. Name a column to receive the bootstrap values. </strong></p>
      <p>In cell M1 type "Bootstrap odds ratios".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb8a" type="checkbox"> Step 8. Write the macro.</strong></p>
      <p>We can write out the series of steps needed to accomplish this task using words instead of VBA code before we
        write the macro - this helps us make sure we know what we need to do, and then we can translate our
        "pseudo-code" into actual VBA code to get the job done. The steps are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For each of 1000 iterations:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Refresh the PivotTable to summarize the current bootstrap sample</li>
          <li>Write the odds ratio for the bootstrap sample from cell I10 into row M below the previous one</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sort the odds ratios from smallest to largest</li>
        <li>Find the 26th and 976th odds ratios and assign them to I13 and I14, respectively</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now we can translate these steps into VBA code. Let's do this one without the macro recorder - open the macros,
        and below the End Sub for BootstrapCI() from last time, enter the following code:</p>
      <img src="macro_nosort.png" alt="Macro">
      <p>This code establishes that this is a macro using Sub and End Sub - the name of the macro is BootstrapOdds().</p>
      <p>The apostrophes are for comments, and aren't executed. We'll write in the key combination we plan to use, but
        we'll need to also set it in the Macro properties later - we'll use CTRL+SHIFT+O to run the macro.</p>
      <p>This code takes care of the first set of commands that are repeated 1000 times, using a For...Next loop. For
        each iteration we refresh the PivotTable (which I assume is called PivotTable1 - if you ended up with a
        different name replace PivotTable1 with whatever names yours was assigned). Then, the odds ratio for the current
        bootstrap sample in cell I10 is assigned to the cell in column M row i + 1 - since i increases by 1 each time
        through the loop this causes the row number to update for each iteration, and the next bootstrap sample's odds
        ratio will be placed below the previous one (it goes into row 2 the first time through, row 3 the second time,
        and so on).</p>
      <p>We don't need to do anything to get a new bootstrap sample drawn each time - refreshing a PivotTable causes the
        entire sheet to recalculate, which causes a new bootstrap sample to be selected.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong><input name="cb10a" type="checkbox"> Step 9. Speed it up, and find the confidence limits.</strong></p>
      <p>To make this run quickly we can turn off screen updating before the loop runs, and turn it back on after the
        macro is finished, like so:</p>
      <img src="screen_updating.png" alt="Updating">
      <p>We should also sort column M, and then record the lower and upper 95% confidence limits, like so:</p>
      <img src="ci_limits.png" alt="CI limits"></div>
    <div>
      <p>NOTE: the font the visual basic editor uses makes it really hard to tell the difference between a lower-case
        letter l and the number 1. Both key1 and order1 use the number 1, and both xlAscending and xlYes use the lower
        case letter l.</p>
      <p>The sort identifies a column, and then invokes its Sort function - everything from key1: to Header: are
        arguments for the Sort operation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>key1:=Range("M2") identifies the first cell in the range that will be sorted</li>
        <li>order1:=xlAscending says that this is to be an ascending sort</li>
        <li>Header:=xlYes says that the first cell in column M is a header label, and is not to be sorted with the rest
          of the column's contents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When this is run all of the bootstrap odds ratios will be sorted from smallest to largest.</p>
      <p>Then, just like last time, since we used 1000 iterations the 2.5th percentile is the 25th largest odds ratio
        (which is in row 26, since row 1 is a header), and the 97.5th percentile is the 975th largest odds ratio (which
        is row 976) - the values in each of these cells are assigned to I13 (which will be the lower limit of the 95%
        CI) and I14 (which will be the upper limit of the 95% CI).</p>
      <p>Note that we don't actually have to do any copy/paste operations - we can just <strong>assign</strong> the
        values from I10 to M i+1, and from M26 and M976 to I13 and I14. This sort of assignment is much faster than
        copying and pasting, so this macro will run very quickly.</p>
      <p><strong><input name="cb10a" type="checkbox"> Step 10. Run the macro. </strong></p>
      <p>We have recorded which key combination we want to use in the comments for the macro, but we haven't told Excel
        what we want to use yet. Switch to your worksheet, and select "Macros" â†’ "View macros". You should see
        "BootstrapCI" listed as one of the macros. Select it, and click "Options", and then assign the key combination
        of CTRL+SHIFT+O.</p>
      <p>Switch to the worksheet and type ctrl+shift+O. It should take about 10 seconds to complete.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In cell H15 tell me whether, based on this analysis, you can say that training as caterpillars carried over
        into the behavior of the adults - if the confidence interval does not include 1, which would indicate no
        difference between the two groups, then the caterpillars remember their training as adults, even though
        metamorphosis rearranges their body tissues.</p>
