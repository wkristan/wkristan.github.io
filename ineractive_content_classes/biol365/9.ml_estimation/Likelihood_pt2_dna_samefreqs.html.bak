      <p>We are told that, unless we have an identical twin, we are genetically unique, and that the particular sequence
        of DNA that we carry in our genome is different from every other person in the world. There is, of course, no
        practical way of confirming this, and a more correct statement would be that the chance that two people will be
        identical across the 3.2 billion bases in our genomes is so small that we don't expect to ever see two
        genetically identical people unless they are identical twins (and even then <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01149-y">somatic
          mutations</a> can occur that cause them to differ). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Given that we expect some genetic differences between any two people we encounter, we can use genotypes across
        different genetic loci (which are just identifiable regions of our DNA) to identify them. Different variants of
        the same genetic locus are called <strong>alleles</strong> of the locus. DNA fingerprinting has been available
        for some time, under the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).</p>
      <img style="width: 473px; height: 400px;" alt="The STR loci" src="STR.jpg" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left">
      <p> The 13 CODIS loci are distributed among 12 of our 22 autosomes, as illustrated in the figure to the left.
        These 13 loci are all short tandem repeats (STR), which refers to the tendency for non-coding regions of our DNA
        (the "junk" DNA we all carry) to have repeating sequences of base pairs adjacent to one another. These
        non-coding, non-functional sequences are highly polymorphic, meaning there are lots of different alleles for
        them in the population, which results in lots of possible combinations of alleles that a person can be carrying.
        With so many possible combinations it is very unlikely that any given set of CODIS STR alleles will be found in
        two different people, and thus the particular combination becomes a useful unique identifier for an individual,
        just like a traditional fingerprint.</p>
      <br style="clear:both">
      <p> The names of the gene loci and their locations on the chromosomes are shown in the figure above. It's
        important that the loci are mostly on different chromosomes, because that ensures that they will assort
        independently, and thus (for example) the probability that a person will receive a particular allele at the TPOX
        locus is not affected by their receiving a different allele at the TH01 locus. In the one case in which two STR
        loci are found on the same chromosome (D5S818 and CSF1PO) they are sufficiently far apart that crossing over
        makes them independent of one another as well.</p>
      <h3>How sure can you be?</h3>
      <p> Consider a typical case in which a spot of blood is found at a murder scene that didn't belong to the victim,
        and a DNA fingerprint is obtained from it. A suspect is apprehended, a sample of his DNA is taken, from which a
        DNA fingerprint is also generated. The suspect's DNA fingerprint matches the fingerprint from the spot of blood
        from the crime scene, but he says he's innocent, and he wasn't even there - the blood must belong to somebody
        else.</p>
      <p>We know that the samples will match if he's the source (assuming no lab errors), but what are the chances of a
        match if the blood actually came from somebody else? How much more likely is it that he's the source than that
        it comes from somebody else?</p>
      <p>We can calculate the likelihood of a match if he's the source pretty easily - if we use probabilities as our
        likelihoods then the likelihood of a match for each of the alleles is 1. Multiplying the likelihoods across all
        of the alleles would still give us a likelihood of a match for every one of the 13 CODIS STR loci of 1. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The more difficult part is to calculate the likelihood of a match if he is not the source of the blood, and
        the blood came from somebody else who happened to have an identical DNA finger print. We will do that
        calculation now.</p>
      <p>We will use a database of CODIS STR loci frequencies obtained from populations of people throughout the US in <a
          href="codis_freqs.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a>, called codis_freqs.xlsx, taken from <a href="pop_data_str_loci.pdf">this
          paper</a> - download the Excel spreadsheet into the same folder as the likelihood_data.xlsx file we used last
        time, and open it. You'll see that there is a column identifying the population, the gene, the allele, and its
        frequency. There is also a column that is concatenating the population, gene, and allele into a single label -
        we'll use this as the basis for looking up frequencies when we do our first analysis.</p>
      <p>Leave the file open, we'll be using it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> <input name="cb1" type="checkbox">Step 1. Open the file we used last time. </strong></p>
      <p>Switch now to sheet "DNA" of the likelihood_data.xlsx file you worked with for ML curve fitting last time, and
        you will see that you have a DNA fingerprint, which is a set of CODIS STR loci (row labels, in the Locus
        column), and the two alleles found at them (columns Allele 1 and Allele 2). The alleles are identified by
        numeric codes - for example, at gene locus D3S1358 this individual has allele #15 and allele #16.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <strong> <input name="cb2" type="checkbox">Step 2. Look up the allele frequencies.</strong></p>
      <p>The database in file codis_freqs.xlsx has the frequencies of each of these alleles, for a variety of
        populations. We would like to have a copy of these frequencies in likelihood_data.xlsx file to make them easier
        to use, which we can do by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the codis_freqs.xlsx file</li>
        <li>Right-click on the "Freqs" tab at the bottom left of the worksheet, and select "Move or Copy"</li>
        <li>Select "likelihood_data.xlsx" as the "To book:", select "(move to end)" in the "Before sheet:" section, and
          check the "Create a copy" box. </li>
        <li>Click "OK", and you should now have a copy of the frequencies in a "Freq" sheet in your assignment file</li>
        <li>Close codis_freqs.xlsx</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We know what the alleles this person has, but we now need to enter their population frequencies from the Freq
        sheet. We could do this by hand, but it would be cumbersome and error prone to transfer all of the allele
        frequencies from the Freqs sheet that way. Instead we'll use spreadsheet formulas to do it for us.</p>
      <p>We need to select the frequencies from the Freq sheet that are the correct population, CODIS locus, and allele
        number, but the function we're using can only look up one cell. We can fix this by concatenating the three
        things we need to use in our lookup into one label:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the label "A1 lookup" in cell D1, and "A2 lookup" in cell E1</li>
        <li>Enter the label "Population" in cell A16, and "Apache" in cell B16 (we'll try out other populations later)</li>
        <li>We will need to look up a combination of population, gene, and allele number from the database, so in cell
          D2 enter <span class="Excel">=$b$16&amp;a2&amp;b2</span> - this will give you a concatenated label
          ApacheD3S134815, which is the population (Apache, in cell b16), gene (D3S1358, in cell a2), and allele (15, in
          cell b2) together</li>
        <li>Copy and paste cell D2 to the rest of the rows (D3 through D14)</li>
        <li>In E2 do the same for allele 2 - concatenate the population, gene, and allele2 together (it will read
          ApacheD32S135816 if all went well)</li>
        <li>Copy and paste cell E2 to the rest of the rows (E3 through E14)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next we will use the xlookup() function to find the right frequencies - this is a new and improved version of
        Excel's lookup(), and is only available in "recent" releases...if you're using Excel 365 on either Windows or
        Mac you'll definitely have it.</p>
      <p>The format for xlookup() is:</p>
      <p>xlookup(value.to.look.up, cell.range.to.look.in.for.matches, cell.range.to.return.if.there.is.a.match,
        value.to.return.if.no.match)</p>
      <p>which for our purposes translates into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the label "p" in cell F1, and "q" in G1 - p is the frequency of the first allele, q is the frequency
          of the second</li>
        <li>In cell F2 enter the formula <span class="Excel">=xlookup(d2, Freqs!$E$2:$E$3180, Freqs!$D$2:$D$3180, 0)</span><span
            class="Excel"></span></li>
        <li>In cell G2 enter the formula <span class="Excel">=xlookup(e2,Freqs!$E$2:$E$3180,Freqs!$D$2:$D$3180,0)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should now see a value of 0.684896 in F2 for p, and 0.184896 in G2 for q. The cell references for the range
        of cells to look for matches and the range of values to return both have a sheet identifier, Freqs!, which point
        to the database of frequencies. </p>
      <p>Select cells F2 and G2, copy and paste them to the rest of the rows - you should now have the allele
        frequencies for the population of Apaches for each allele.</p>
      <p>These allele frequencies can be used as probabilities - the frequency in the p column for D3S1358 of 0.684896
        is also the probability of randomly selecting an allele for that gene from the population and having it be
        allele 15. We can treat probabilities as likelihoods - the probability of 0.684896 is also the likelihood of
        allele 15 for someone from the Apache population. Looking up the frequencies from the database also enters the
        likelihoods for each allele.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> <input name="cb2" type="checkbox">Step 3. Calculate the genotype frequencies. </strong></p>
      <p>The fingerprint is not just a set of alleles, it is a set of genotypes, and we need to calculate the likelihood
        of the genotypes from the likelihoods of the alleles.</p>
      <p>During fertilization, the alleles contributed by mother and father combine to give the offspring his or her
        genotype. The CODIS loci are all neutral, non-coding junk DNA, so we expect them to combine at random, and we
        can predict the genotype frequencies from the allele frequencies like so:</p>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p> Based on this table, homozygotes for the p allele would occur at a frequency of p<sup>2</sup>, homozygotes for
        the q allele would occur at a frequency of q<sup>2</sup>, and heterozygotes would occur at a frequency of pq +
        pq, or 2pq. These frequencies would also be the likelihoods of the genotypes.</p>
      <p>Note that the formula we need to use is different for homozygotes and heterozygotes. We can make the
        calculation performed depend on whether the gene is homozygous or heterozygous by using the "if()" function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the label "Genotype frequency" in column H1</li>
        <li>Enter the formula <span class="Excel">=if(b2=c2, f2*g2, 2*f2*g2)</span> in cell H2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first argument for the if() function is a logical test - here, we test whether the allele numbers are the
        same for both Allele 1 and Allele 2 in cells b2 and c2. If they are then the second argument is used for the
        calculation; the calculation is f2 * g2, and if this is a homozygote then the two alleles are the same, and
        multiplying its frequency by itself squares it. If the logical test is false (i.e. b2 isn't equal to c2) then
        they are heterozygous for the gene, and the calculation used is 2*f2*g2. </p>
      <p>Now that you have the first one done you can copy and paste H2 to H3 through H14 to calculate the genotype
        frequencies for the rest of the loci.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> <input name="cb5" type="checkbox">Step 4. Calculate the likelihood of the entire fingerprint if the
          suspect is not the source of the blood. </strong></p>
      <p>To calculate the likelihood of the entire set, we need only to multiply the likelihoods of each genotype. In
        cell G16 enter the label "Likelihood", and in H16 multiply the likelihoods together with <span class="Excel">=product(h2:h14)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> <input name="cb6" type="checkbox">Step 5. Calculate the ratio of likelihoods. </strong></p>
      <p>The value you just calculated in cell H16 is the likelihood of a match if the person this fingerprint came from
        is <em><strong>not the source of the blood sample</strong></em>. Since we're using probabilities as likelihoods
        here, we can also interpret this as a probability - the probability of randomly selecting a person from the
        population who is not the source of the blood, but nevertheless has a DNA fingerprint that matched the one from
        the crime scene, is thus 1.1701E-13.</p>
      <p>As you read in the introduction above, the probability of a match if the suspect is the source of the blood is
        1 - and thus, the likelihood is also 1.</p>
      <p>We can calculate the ratio of two likelihoods to see how much more likely one is compared to the other - that
        is, we can calculate how much more likely it is that the sample matches because the suspect is the source of the
        blood than that the suspect is not the source but the fingerprint just matches by chance.</p>
      <p> Enter the label "Likelihood ratio" in cell G18, and in H18 enter =1/H16.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> This ratio tells you how many times more likely it is that this person is the source of the blood than that he
        is not the source of the blood - using the Apache allele frequencies, you'll get a value of 8.5462E+12. You can
        think of this as being equivalent to the number of people you would need to select before you would expect to
        match this DNA fingerprint by chance (there are currently about 7 billion people on the planet, which is 7 x 10<sup>9</sup>,
        so it would take about 1000 times more people than there currently are on the planet before we'd expect a match
        from somebody who wasn't the actual source of the blood).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="assignment_test">Assignment testing</h2>
      <p>Another thing we can do with this DNA fingerprint is to predict which population the blood sample comes from.
        We have allele frequencies from multiple populations in the Freqs sheet, and we can calculate likelihoods of
        coming from each population given the DNA fingerprint of the person - the population with the highest likelihood
        is the one the person most likely came from. </p>
      <p>Note that we're using STR data as a convenience, since we already have everything set up for it. But these are
        not necessarily the best loci to use for inferring ancestry (services like 23 and Me use single nucleotide
        polymorphisms, or SNP for short, instead of STR loci). However, this exercise will give you an idea of how the
        analysis is done. </p>
      <p>**IMPORTANT** I thought of an improvement to this part of the exercise at the last minute, which makes
        everything that is currently in the WhichPopulation sheet unnecessary. We now just want that sheet to be blank,
        so do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the WhichPopulation sheet in the likelihood_data.xlsx file you started last time</li>
        <li>Click on the triangle to the left of the A column, and above the 1 row - you should see that the entire
          sheet is selected</li>
        <li>Hit the "Delete" key on your keyboard - you should have a blank sheet now for WhichPopulation</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><input name="cb8" type="checkbox"></strong>1. <strong>Get a list of the populations</strong>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Switch to the Freqs sheet, and you'll see that the populations we have for assignment testing are in column A.
        This is a long list, though, and we just need each population to be listed once in our WhichPopulation sheet. We
        can extract this list using an advanced filter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on A to select the entire Population column</li>
        <li>Switch to the Data tab, find the "Sort &amp; Filter" buttons, and click on "Advanced"</li>
        <li>In the "Advanced Filter" window that pops up, click on the "Copy to another location" button</li>
        <li>The "List range" should be set to $A$1:$A$3180, which is every cell with an entry in column A - this is
          fine, no change</li>
        <li>Enter G1 into the "Criteria range" - this is used to specify what we want to select from the column, but we
          don't actually want to exclude anything, we just need a single copy of each population's label, so we can use
          a blank cell here (if we wanted only certain populations we could enter them in a set of cells and use those
          as criteria)</li>
        <li>In the "Copy to:" box enter the cell H1 - we can only filter within the same sheet, so we'll put the list
          here for now</li>
        <li>Click on the "Unique records only" box - this will cause just a single copy of each population to be
          returned</li>
        <li>Click "OK"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll now have a list of the populations in column H. Select the whole list, including the Population column
        heading, and paste it to cell A3 of the WhichPopulation sheet - we'll stay in WhichPopulation for the rest of
        the exercise.</p>
      <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,sans-serif;">Enter the label "Likelihoods" in cell A1.</span><br>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb10" type="checkbox">2. <strong>Calculate the likelihoods of the populations given the DNA
          fingerprint</strong>. </p>
      <p>Now that we have our list of populations we'll calculate the likelihood of each one, and enter it in column B,
        next to the labels</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter "Likelihood" in cell B3</li>
        <li>Copy the first population in cell A4 (select the cell and copy it)</li>
        <li>Switch to "DNA" and paste the cell in cell B16, next to the "Population:" label - the likelihood will update
          for this new population</li>
        <li>Copy the likelihood in cell H6, switch to the WhichPopulation sheet, and paste-special its value in cell B4,
          next to the population's label</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Repeat these steps for each population - when you're done you should have a likelihood in column B for every
        population in column A</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb11" type="checkbox">3. <strong>Identify the largest likelihood</strong>.</p>
      <p>We want to assign this DNA fingerprint to the population with the largest likelihood, which is easier to find
        if we use conditional formatting. Conditional formatting sets some aspect of the display of a cell depending on
        the cell's value, by itself or relative to other cells in a range that you specify.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the cells B4 through B15</li>
        <li>Click on "<span class="popup">Conditional Formatting<img class="popupimage" src="conditional_formatting.jpeg"></span>"
          in the "Home" tab, and select "Top/Bottom Rules", then "<span class="popup">More rules...<img class="popupimage"
              src="conditional_formatting2.jpeg"></span>". </li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the "New Formatting Rule" window, find the "Edit the Rule Description" area, and set the number to 1 so
            that only the highest value will be formatted differently. </li>
          <li>Then, click on "Format...", and change the format to bold italics. This will set the format of the largest
            likelihood ratio to a bold italic, which makes it easy to identify.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You should see that the SW Hispanic population has the highest likelihood - if we were going to predict which
        of these populations the suspect belonged to we would predict that they are SW Hispanic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <input name="cb11" type="checkbox">4. <strong>Calculate likelihood ratios for all the populations</strong>.</p>
      <p>We now know that the population with the highest likelihood for this fingerprint is SW Hispanic, but how much
        greater is the likelihood? We can calculate ratios for every pair of ratios to find out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter "Likelihood ratios" in cell D2</li>
        <li>Copy the list of populations in A3 through A15 and paste them into D3 through D15</li>
        <li>Copy the SW Hispanic label from A8 and paste it into E3</li>
        <li>In cell E4 enter the formula<span class="Excel"> =xlookup(e$3, $a$4:$a$15,
            $b$4:$b$15)/xlookup(d4,$a$4:$a$15, $b$4:$b$15)</span> - you are dividing the SW Hispanic population
          likelihood by the African American Bahamian Jamaican population's likelihood for this first calculation, which
          is equal to 86.42. </li>
        <li>Copy and paste E4 to the rest of the cells below, and you'll get a ratio of SW Hispanic likelihood to each
          other population in the list</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This formula uses the population in the column labels (e3) to look up the likelihood for the numerator (which
        is SW Hispanic for every calculation), and then uses the population in the row labels (d4) to look up the
        likelihood for the denominator. By using a dollar sign before the row number in e$3 we can copy and paste this
        formula to the rows below and continue to point at the column label in row 3.</p>
      <p>We can use the same trick we did to find the maximum likelihood to highlight the maximum ratio.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select cells E4 to E15, and get to the same formatting rule editor as you did for the maximum likelihood.</li>
        <li>Set the rule to find the top 1 value, and change its format to bold italic with red text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you are done, you'll see that the likelihood ratio is pretty small for several populations (Caucasian, SE
        hispanic), and is most different from Filipino. Given this, we would not be very confident in concluding that
        this person is from a SW Hispanic population rather than a SE Hispanic or Caucasian population, but can be
        fairly certain they are not Filipino.</p>
