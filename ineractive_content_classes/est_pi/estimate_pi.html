    <p>We know that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
      diameter - regardless of the size of the circle C/d = 3.14159.</p>
    <p>We know the value of π, and don't really need to estimate it. We can take
      advantage of the fact we know its value, though, to learn about
      estimation.</p>
    <p>A circle with radius r has an area of πr<sup>2</sup>, which we'll call C.
      A square that contains the circle, such that the circle touches all four
      sides of the square, will have a side length of 2r, and an area of (2r)<sup>2</sup>
      or 4r<sup>2</sup> - we'll call this area S. The ratio of the area of the
      circle to the area of the square is thus:</p>
    <p><img src="area_ratios.png" alt="Area ratios" title="Area ratios"> </p>
    <p>Solving for π gives us an estimator for π in terms of the relative areas
      of the circle and square:</p>
    <p><img src="est_pi.png" alt="Estimate pi" title="Estimate pi"></p>
    <p>Now, if you look at the picture below you'll see that some points are
      being randomly placed, all of which fall inside the square and some of
      which also fall inside the circle. If we assume that the number that will
      fall in the circle is proportional to the size of the circle, we can count
      up how many fall inside the circle as an index of the size of the circle
      (in statistics an index is a variable that is expected to change
      consistently when another variable changes, and can thus be used as an
      indicator of the second variable). The total number of points is an index
      of the size of the square. Multiplying the number of points falling inside
      of the circle by 4 and dividing by the number of points in the square
      gives us an estimator for π.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p> If you hit the "Randomize" button a new set of points is
      selected, with the number created equal to the sample size specified. Each
      time you select a new set of points you'll generate a new estimate, which
      is added to the histogram on the right. The average of the estimates is
      reported as "Mean of estimates of π = ". As you select multiple sets of
      points you'll see that the estimates vary, and will not equal 3.14. You
      can click the "Select 1,000" button to repeat the selection 1,000 times,
      and if you do you'll see that the mean of the estimates is close to 3.14.
      This shows you that this estimator is <strong>unbiased</strong> - the
      average of the estimates equals the value we are estimating. A biased
      estimate would give us an average of the estimates that is not equal to
      3.14.</p>
    <p>Even with a small sample size of 10 the estimator is unbiased. Increasing
      the sample size isn't necessary to get an unbiased estimate, but it does
      give us better precision. Try increasing to sample size to 100 and see how
      1,000 estimates at that sample size vary. You should see that the
      estimates fall closer on average to 3.14, so any single estimate based on
      a sample size of 100 will tend to be closer to the correct value than a
      sample of size 10. You can increase the sample size to 1000 and the
      precision will be even better.</p>
