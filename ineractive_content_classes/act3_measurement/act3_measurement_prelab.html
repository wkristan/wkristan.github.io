      <p class="part" id="intro">Before we progress into statistical analysis,
        it's important to recognize the importance of collecting high-quality
        data. The old admonishment that "garbage in leads to garbage out"
        applies abundantly to statistical analysis - there is no reason to
        expect that collecting large amounts of bad data will lead to more
        reliable results than collecting small amounts of bad data.</p>
      <h2 class="part">Making measurements</h2>
      <p>The first step in making good measurements is to <strong>operationally
          define</strong> our variables. Operational definitions are more than
        just identification of the variable type and measurement scales - they
        are detailed definitions of how variables are actually to be measured.</p>
      <p><img style="width: 298px; height: 189px; float:left; margin-right: 20px"
          alt="Measuring a snake" src="measuring-corn-snake.jpg">Objective
        features are the easiest to operationally define. For example, if we
        wanted to operationally define lengths of snakes that we capture in a
        field, we would need to include things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Should the snake be measured from the tip of the tail to the tip of
          the snout? Or should we measure "snout/vent length", which is the
          distance from the anterior end of the vent (i.e. the excretory opening
          on its belly) to the snout?</li>
        <li>Should the animal be straightened against a straight edge when the
          measurements are made? Should it be anesthetized to prevent it from
          shortening during measurement?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In general, the goal of a good operational definition is to produce
        measurements that are <strong>objective</strong> and <strong>repeatable</strong>.
        Objective means that the measurements should not require judgment on the
        part of the researcher - the definition should be so clear that every
        opportunity for different people to choose to do different things is
        eliminated, and it becomes unnecessary to make a judgment call.
        Repeatable means that multiple measurements of the same object will give
        the same data value.</p>
      <p>Operational definitions also typically include information about the
        equipment used, in case different instruments perform differently when
        used to make the measurement. If the length of the snake is measured
        with a rigid ruler the results may be different than if a flexible tape
        measure is used.</p>
      <p>Some variables are intrinsically subjective, like pain levels, colors,
        tastes, etc., and these are the most difficult variables to
        operationally define. When subjective variables can't be avoided it is
        important to be especially careful in operationally defining them.</p>
      <p>Consider something as simple as hair color. We can name common colors
        easily: black, brown, blonde, gray, and red. But, these are not discrete
        levels, the colors grade into each other, and whether a "strawberry
        blonde" should be assigned to blonde or red is a judgment call. As a
        person ages gray hairs are intermixed with their original hair color,
        and deciding at what point a person is gray-haired instead of their
        original color again requires a judgment call.</p>
      <p><img style="width: 457px; height: 457px; float: left; margin-right: 10px"
          alt="Munsell" src="M50215B-YRKIT-munsell-soil-color-2-pack-product-1.jpg"><img
          style="float: right; width: 189px; height: 246px; margin-left: 10px" src="portable_colorimeter.jpg">One
        approach to dealing with subjective variables is to develop a set of
        standards to compare against. The picture on the left is an example of
        two pages from a Munsell color book meant to be used to assess the color
        of soil samples. Each color chip is one of a set of pre-defined standard
        colors, based on three characteristics: hue (the base color), value
        (lightness), and chroma (color purity). The tiles on the page in front
        are all based on Hue 10YR (a yellowish red color), with value decreasing
        from top to bottom (numbered 8 at the top through 2 at the bottom), and
        with chroma increasing from left to right (numbered 1 on the left to 8
        on the right). Soil samples can be held behind the pages and viewed
        through the holes, and the color with the closest match is recorded as
        the color of the soil - for example, a best match to the chip in the
        upper right corner of the first page would be recorded as 10YR 8/8 to
        indicate the soil has a hue of 10YR, a value of 8, and a chroma of 8.</p>
      <p>Using color chips doesn't completely eliminate judgment calls, but it
        greatly reduces them. Another approach that is an even more objective
        way of measuring color is to use a colorimeter, like the portable model
        shown to the right. Colorimeters are devices that emit a very white
        light that reflects off of the object being measured, so that the
        colorimeter can get very accurate measurements of the reflected light's
        wavelength. Since the colorimeter uses its own light source it
        eliminates differences in color that might be due to differences in the
        color of the light in the environment, and thus gives a more objective,
        repeatable measure of color than would be possible by using color chips.
        The standard color chips and colorimeter are big improvements for
        judging pure colors, but mixes of color (such as the salt and pepper
        hair of a black-haired person who is turning gray) would still require a
        judgment call.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the variable used, though, it is extremely important that
        variable definitions are as clear and detailed as possible, so that
        judgment by the observer doesn't affect the data.</p>
      <h2 class="part" style="clear: both">Definition of precision and accuracy
        for single measurements </h2>
      <p>Once a variable is properly operationally defined, we still need to
        consider the <span style="font-weight: bold;">precision</span> and <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">accuracy</span> of our measurements. You
        have doubtless heard these terms before, probably with respect to single
        measurements. We'll review the meaning of these terms as they pertain to
        single measurements first, and then we will see how they are applied in
        statistics. </p>
      <p>A single measurement is accurate if it is equal to the actual value. </p>

          <tr>
            <td><img src="accuracy_shrub_measure.png" alt="Measuring" style="width: 267px; height: 283px; float:left; padding:10px;">
              <p>Consider this simple example - if we were trying to measure the
                height of this bush, the measurement would be accurate if we
                recorded 1 m as the height.</p>
              <p>A measurement that is not accurate would have a value different
                from the true height of the bush, but accuracy is not an all or
                nothing thing; there are degrees of accuracy. For example, even
                though a measurement of 1.5 wouldn't be accurate, it's more
                accurate than a measurement of 2 m. The closer a measurement is
                to the true value the more accurate it is, even if it's not
                exactly equal to the true value.</p>
              <p>In this simple example we are only measuring to the nearest 1
                m, which is pretty coarse - bushes are not very tall, and
                measuring to the nearest meter will probably only give us two or
                three possible measurements (perhaps a 0 for short ones, 1 for
                medium sized ones, and 2 for tall ones). So, while our
                measurement of 1 m may be accurate it's not a very satisfactory
                level of precision.</p>

      <p>For a single measurement, precision refers to the size of the units of
        measure that we use for making our measurement. Precision is represented
        by the <b>significant digits</b> that we measure and record. </p>
      <p>Instruments differ in the precision of measurement they are capable of.
        The smallest value the instrument is capable of measuring is the <strong>resolution</strong>
        of the instrument, which in turn dictates the upper limit of precision
        we're capable of achieving with the instrument. To see how resolution
        affects the precision we are able to achieve, consider the simple
        example below in which we measure the length of a line. </p>

                1 mm).</p>
              <p>With the third ruler we can accurately measure the line to 0.1
                cm, and measuring to this level we would record the length of
                the line as 1.6 cm. </p>
              <p>The second ruler only has hash marks 1 cm apart - we might be
                able to confidently judge whether the line is closer to the
                middle or to the hash marks at 1 or 2, in which case we could
                measure to the nearest 0.5 cm. Trying to record the length down
                to 0.1 cm would not be reliable, so we would measure the length
                of the line as 1.5 cm.</p>
              <p>The top ruler only has hash marks at 4 cm intervals, so we
                could only reliably measure the line to the nearest 2 cm. We
                would measure the line as 2 cm long using the top ruler.</p>
              <p>The resolution of the instrument thus sets the upper limit to
                the precision of our measurements - our measurements can't be
                more precise than the instrument is capable of.<br>

      <p> Note that each of the measurements above are accurate to the level of
        precision at which we are measuring. The bottom ruler allows us to be
        accurate to 1 mm, but a measurement of 1.5 cm is accurate to the 1/2
        centimeter level, and the measurement of 2 cm is accurate to the 2 cm
        level. The finer the resolution of the instrument we use the closer we
        can get to the actual length of the line.</p>
      <p>This way of thinking about accuracy and precision is not how
        statisticians use the terms, however. When statisticians talk about
        accuracy and precision, they are describing the properties of <em>collections
          of measurements</em>, not individual measurements. We will now move on
        to the statistical meaning of these terms.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="stat def">Statistical definition of precision and
        accuracy</h2>
      <p>From a statistical standpoint, the definitions of accuracy and
        precision are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - a collection of measurements are
          accurate if their average equals the actual value they are measuring.
          If the average does not equal the actual value, the measurements are <strong>biased</strong>.
          Statistically speaking, therefore, bias is synonymous with "not
          accurate".</li>
        <li><strong>Precision</strong> - a collection of measurements is precise
          if the measurements are close together. You can think of statistical
          precision as a measure of the repeatability of measurements - when
          repeated measurements are similar, precision is high. The more
          variable repeated measurements are, the lower the precision of the
          measurements is.</li>

              </video>
              <p>A common way to illustrate statistical precision and accuracy
                is with arrow sticks on a target, like in this video. Consider
                the center of the target to be the true value we are trying to
                measure, and each x is an attempt to measure it.</p>
              <p>Run the video, and you'll see that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accuracy means to be correct on average</li>
                <li>Precision is having measurements that are close together,
                  and thus repeatable</li>
                <li>The best case is to be accurate and precise, the worst case
                  is to be inaccurate (biased) and imprecise</li>
                <li>It's possible to be accurate and imprecise, and inaccurate
                  (biased) and precise</li>

      <p>At the end of the animation the four possible combinations of accuracy
        and precision are illustrated, with precise clusters of points on the
        left side, and points that are correct on average (and thus are
        accurate) along the top row.</p>
      <h3>Bias is not a character flaw in statistics</h3>
      <p>Obviously, we would like our data to be both precise and accurate, and
        the worst case is to be biased and imprecise. Consider, though, that
        bias is only one of the two ways to make bad measurements! Being a
        little biased in order to gain a high level of precision may at times be
        better than being unbiased but with very low repeatability. </p>
      <p>This may strike you as odd, because in everyday usage the term "bias"
        is a word that carries some ethical baggage. We consider "bias" to mean
        bigoted, closed-minded, or unreasonable. Even in the sciences, we use
        "bias" as the opposite of "objective" when we use the term outside of
        our statistical analysis of data, and a biased scientist is one who
        prejudges issues, or ignores evidence that disagrees with his or her
        opinions. In statistics, however, bias has a more specific, technical
        meaning, and statistical bias is not intrinsically worse than low
        precision. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="choose instrument">Choice of measuring instruments</h2>
      <p>In the real world, different instruments can often be selected for the
        same task. We need to select instruments that have an appropriate
        resolution, and that can be applied correctly to the task at hand.</p>
      <h3>Resolution and the Rule of 30</h3>
      <p>If we're measuring a continuous variable, the instrument we use will
        have sufficient resolution if it produces few or no repeated
        measurements (if we have fewer than 30 observations), or if it produces
        at least 30 different values in the data set (if we have a sample size
        greater than 30) - this is the <strong>rule of 30</strong>. If we abide
        by this rule we can treat our variable as though it is continuous, even
        though we know that we have converted it to a discrete variable by
        measuring to a set level of precision (remember the "implied interval"
        of our measurements of continuous variables).</p>

          <tr>
            <td><img src="measuring%20AA.jpg" alt="Measuring teeth" style="float: left; padding: 10px;">
              <p>Consider this example of measuring the length of teeth in a
                deer's jaw. The lengths of adult deer teeth generally fall
                between 90 and 110 mm, which is a range of 20 mm. A ruler with a
                resolution of 1 mm could only give us 20/1 = 20 possible
                measurements, which is too few by our rule of 30.</p>
              <p>Calipers, like the one shown in the picture, can measure to the
                nearest 0.1 mm, which means there are 20/0.01 = 200 possible
                different measurements, which is plenty by the rule of 30. Based
                on the Rule of 30, given the choice between a ruler and
                calipers, we should use the calipers.</p>

      </table>
      <h3>Usability of the instrument</h3>
      <p>So, based on the rule of 30 we should use a calipers to measure deer
        teeth. However, resolution is not the only consideration. </p>
      <p>We may find that there are practical problems that prevent us from
        achieving the maximum precision an instrument is capable of. You can see
        in the deer tooth example, calipers work by closing the jaws on the
        object you are measuring. The teeth are still embedded in the deer's
        jaw, so it's possible to place the top jaw of the calipers on top of the
        tooth, but the bottom jaw of the calipers is laid next to the base of
        the tooth. The researcher has to judge by eye where the tooth emerges
        from the deer's jaw, and there is some personal judgment involved in
        doing this measurement. Measurements that require personal judgment are
        problematic, because different observers may select a different point
        for the base of the tooth. If we are only able to consistently position
        the calipers within 0.5 mm of the base of the tooth, then our
        measurements are actually only accurate to 0.5 mm, even though the
        resolution of the instrument is 0.1 mm.</p>
      <p>This is not ideal, but a ruler would probably be even worse, as it
        would have to be laid across the tooth, and the top and bottom would
        both have to be judged by the researcher. So, the calipers have an edge
        over a ruler based both on the rule of 30 and on usability, and thus
        calipers are better tools for this task.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="causes variation">Causes of measurement variation</h2>
      <p>Variation in measurements leads to lower precision (in the statistical
        sense of lower repeatability), and in general we want to be as precise
        as possible. It's desirable to reduce the variability in our
        measurements, but to do so we need to be aware of the causes of
        variation. </p>
      <p>There are many causes of variation in data, but common ones include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Natural, biological variation among objects.</li>
        <li>Difficulty in using the measurement instrument.</li>
        <li>Inter-observer effects.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Natural variation in measurements is not under our control, and is an
        intrinsic part of studying biological organisms. This is the only
        variation in our data that is a real property of the organisms we are
        studying. There are things we can do to minimize natural variation in
        our data (which we will discuss in greater detail when we talk about
        experimental design), but we won't ever eliminate natural variation from
        our data. The second and third causes of variation <em>are</em> under
        our control, though, and we would like to minimize or eliminate them. </p>
      <p>The second cause (difficulty in using the instrument) was mentioned
        above - a caliper may be difficult to use to measure the length of a
        tooth. We can minimize this source of variation by selecting instruments
        that are well suited to the task at hand. </p>
      <p>The third cause, <strong>inter-observer effects</strong>, are
        differences from person to person in how a measurement is made. This
        "inter-observer variability" is a potentially major problem, and we
        should expect to have problems with inter-observer effects any time
        personal judgment is needed to make measurements. For example, colors,
        types of behaviors, and qualitative categories (such as "warm",
        "cloudy", "comfortable", etc.) are notoriously difficult to standardize
        among observers. Quantitative measurements are easier to standardize,
        requiring only that every observer uses the same instruments and follows
        the same protocols, and are preferred to qualitative ones. However, bear
        in mind that even quantitative measurements can result in inter-observer
        effects if you don't carefully define the quantity you are measuring,
        devise protocols for measuring the quantity, and train all observers to
        follow these protocols exactly.</p>

                worms and snail shells. We will measure each object with two
                different scientific instruments (calipers and rulers). Based on
                our measurements we will determine two things:</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><strong>Accuracy</strong> â€“ can you use a caliper and a ruler equally
        effectively to measure both worm length and shell diameter? Should an
        instrument be avoided for one or the other object? Do the instruments
        allow unbiased measurements of both objects?</p>
      <p> <strong>Precision</strong> â€“ how repeatable are the measurements? Are
        both objects equally easy to measure precisely? Are we able to achieve
        the maximum possible precision (as determined by the instrument) in our
        measurements of each object? How many significant digits should we
        record, given our ability to get the same measurement from the same
        object in repeated attempts?</p>
