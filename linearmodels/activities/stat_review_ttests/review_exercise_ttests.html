        <p>Before we get underway, we will want to make use of your OneDrive for
          all class files. Storing class files in OneDrive will make them
          accessible whether you work from home through Citrix, or using a
          locally-installed version of R Studio, or on campus.</p>
        <p>To make OneDrive files available to programs that run through Citrix
          we first need to go to <a href="https://kumo.csusm.edu/">https://kumo.csusm.edu/</a>
          and log in with your campus username and password. Then, find
          "OneDrive - CSUSM" and drop down its menu and select "Authorize" - you
          should now be able to access any files stored in your OneDrive from
          any computer on campus, through programs run through CougarApps, and
          if you have OneDrive installed on your computer at home you can access
          them there as well.</p>
        <p>You only need to use kumo once, so once this is done you shouldn't
          have to do it again all semester (if you already did it previously you
          don't need to do it again).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 class="part">A little background on R</h2>
      <p>The statistical package we are using for this class, called "R", is
        free of charge. The reason for this is interesting, and before we start
        on the exercise, you should know a little about the software.</p>
      <p>R is an "open source" implementation of the S+ statistical computing
        language, and is available for several different computing platforms
        (Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems). Open
        source software is developed in a collaborative way by teams of
        programmers, often on a volunteer basis. There are many reasons that
        programmers choose to participate in open source projects (some are
        paid, some do it for personal satisfaction, etc.), but from a user's
        perspective there are several practical advantages to using open source
        software, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "source code" written by the programmers can be reviewed by
          other programmers, or even by users if they know how, which provides a
          form of peer review for the code. Peer review is an important quality
          control mechanism in scientific work, and it has the same benefits in
          software development. </li>
        <li>Openness in the development process promotes a cooperative attitude
          in the users, which can lead to a tremendous amount of contributed
          code; the benefit of this becomes obvious both through R's impressive
          feature set, as well the huge number of contributed extensions that
          allow R to perform some very specialized types of data analysis. You
          can see the list of available add-on packages <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">here</a>,
          grouped by the type of problem the add-on is useful for addressing.
          You will find contributed packages that do anything from estimating
          home range sizes from animal point locations, to analysis of genomics
          experiments. As of this writing there are over 10,000 contributed
          packages available, and it is likely that whatever analysis task you
          encounter there will be at least one package that can perform the
          analysis you need.</li>
        <li>Open source software generally embraces open standards, including
          open file formats. Because of this, you will not have your data locked
          in a file format that can only be opened if you continue to license a
          particular software package. For example, if you entered all your data
          into a system that CSUSM licensed (we'll call it DataAnalytica), and
          then they let the license lapse because it was too expensive, you may
          not be able to open your own data files again unless you paid for a
          licensed copy of DataAnalytica yourself. With open data file formats
          any software developer can write an import filter that can open the
          file, so you would be free to move to another software platform
          without losing your data.</li>
        <li>Because the code is contributed for free, open source software is
          usually distributed free of charge, which is true of R.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>R is a flexible, comprehensive platform for statistical analysis and
        graphics. It is extremely powerful, but by itself it is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span>
        user friendly. To make it friendlier and more efficient to use, we will
        use a second program as our interface to access R, and to make it much
        easier to learn and to use for real work.</p>
      <h2 id="rstudio" class="part">A kinder, gentler interface</h2>
      <p>If you were to download R by itself, install and launch it, you will
        see a program that looks like <a href="rgui.png">this</a> (on Windows).
        The "R Console" is where commands are issued, and the graphical user
        interface (or GUI) that is distributed is very rudimentary - there are
        no menus for running statistical analyses or making graphs like you get
        with MINITAB, and all of the menu selections and buttons are for opening
        and saving R's "workspaces", printing output, or managing add-on
        packages.</p>
      <p>There are GUI's that have been developed for R that make it run more
        like MINITAB, but they can be limiting - particularly later in the
        semester when we learn about model-based inference we will make good use
        of R's commands to run multiple analyses that have only slightly
        different code, which is much more efficient with written commands than
        with a menu-based GUI. If you're going to use R, it's good to learn to
        write R code.</p>
      <p>However, R by itself has some limitations that make it hard to use,
        particularly for complex analysis tasks. Instead of using a full-blown
        graphical interface, we will be using an <strong>integrated development
          environment</strong> (or IDE) designed specifically for R, called R
        Studio. R Studio is not a graphical interface to R's statistical
        analysis, we will still need to write code to use it, but it is a
        graphical interface to such useful things as accessing help files,
        browsing for and importing data files, managing graphs, and editing R
        commands. It also helps organize and document your work, and using it
        makes it possible to spot and revise errors (and in particular, using it
        along with the R markdown file format, it makes it very easy for you to
        share your work with me so I can help you spot errors). It is the tool I
        use in my own work, and it is well worth the effort to learn.</p>
      <h3>Starting R Studio and importing your first data set</h3>
      <p>Find R Studio in the Start menu, and launch it. You will see a window
        that looks like this:</p>
      <div id="rstudio_map"> <a href="#" id="console" class="tooltip"><span>Console</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="fileMenu" class="tooltip"><span>Menu bar (File menu)</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="projectMenu" class="tooltip"><span>Project menu</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="environmentTab" class="tooltip"><span>Environment tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="historyTab" class="tooltip"><span>History tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="filesTab" class="tooltip"><span>Files tab</span></a> <a
          href="#" id="plotsTab" class="tooltip"><span>Plots tab</span></a> <a
          href="#" id="packagesTab" class="tooltip"><span>Packages tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="helpTab" class="tooltip"><span>Help tab</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both">If you move your mouse over the picture above
        you'll see popups that indicate the location of the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Console - where R commands are entered, and output is displayed</li>
        <li>Menu bar - where the File menu is found (and other menus that we
          will learn about as needed) </li>
        <li>The Project menu - where projects can be created, opened, or closed</li>
        <li>Environment tab - where all the objects in our workspace will be
          displayed. The environment is active working space, in computer
          memory.</li>
        <li>History tab - a list of the commands used, which can be selected and
          re-used</li>
        <li>Files tab - where the files in the current working directory are
          displayed. These are files stored on disk, rather than being loaded in
          computer memory. We would need to load a data file from disk into
          memory for it to appear in the Environment, and to be usable by R.</li>
        <li>Plots tab - where any graphs we make will be viewed (and from where
          they can be exported)</li>
        <li>Packages tab - where add-on packages that are currently installed
          can be loaded for use</li>
        <li>Help tab - where help files can be searched and viewed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first thing we will do is to make a new project for this exercise -
        this will be the first thing you do for each week's exercise, so this is
        the first of many!</p>
      <h3 id="projects" class="part">Start a new project for this exercise</h3>
      <p>One of the best reasons to use R Studio is that it makes management of
        your work in R much easier. An excellent example of that is in its
        management of your R session. All of the data you import, and any
        results that you assign to "objects" within R will be saved in an R
        "workspace", which is a file that is saved to disk, usually called
        .RData (note the period before the R). R will also save a history file,
        called .Rhistory, that contains all the commands you issued (including
        the mistakes!). However, all the other things that you create, such as
        your statistical output and graphs, do not get saved by R. To
        (partially) fix this, R Studio uses "projects", which are folders that
        contain everything you are working on in your R session, as well as a
        project file that keeps track of the state of your R Studio session the
        last time you saved it. When you open a project file, you will see your
        session in the state you last saved it, so that you can pick up where
        you left off. There are still some things that are not saved (the output
        and graphs, for example), but we will enter all of our commands into a
        file that can be run to reproduce all of the output easily.</p>
      <p>To make a new project, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "File" → "New Project..."</li>
        <li>In the "Create Project" window, select "New Directory".</li>
        <li>In the "Project Type" window select "New Project".</li>
        <li>In the "Create New Project" window we will name the new folder
          (a.k.a. directory) that will contain our project:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter "review1" as the directory name. </li>
          <li>We also need to set the folder that we will use for all the
            projects you make in class, so click on "Browse" and navigate to
            your OneDrive. Make a folder in OneDrive for this class (with the
            "New folder" button - name the folder "Biol531"), and then select
            Biol531 as the folder that will hold your new project.</li>
          <li>Click "Create Project" to create the new project.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you're done you'll see that the Environment tab is blank, except
        for a gray "Environment is empty" label, and the "Files" tab shows a
        review1.Rproj file, which is the new project file that R Studio just
        created. The thin status bar just above the "Name" label shows that you
        are looking at the contents of the new folder you just created on your
        OneDrive. This is your "working directory", which R will use for output
        files, and where it will look for any input files unless you tell it
        otherwise.</p>
      <h3>Add a "R Markdown" file template to your project</h3>
      <p>We will be using something called "markdown" to record our work. Even
        with an RStudio project we would lose the output from our commands,
        including test results and graphs, each time we exited RStudio. We can
        avoid that by recording what we do in a file that uses R's version of
        markdown, which is a text formatting language (if you have ever done any
        Web development you've used HTML, which is short for hypertext markup
        language, which gives instructions for how to assemble a document using
        tags. Markdown is a simplified version of a markup language). The
        advantage of R markdown is that we can embed chunks of R code, which can
        be executed to obtain output, and we can annotate the code and output in
        a way that helps us remember what we did and why. If you discover an
        error you can find the code chunk containing the error, fix it, and then
        execute any additional code chunks to fix any output that was affected
        by the error.</p>
      <p>I will be providing you with templates of R markdown documents for each
        exercise - this week's file is called "review1.Rmd", and is <a href="review1.Rmd"
          title="Review 1 R markdown document">here</a>. Download it and put it
        into your working directory.</p>
      <p>Once it's in your working directory, find the file in the "Files" tab
        of R Studio, and click on it to open it. You will see a series of
        instructions, explanations, and questions with "code chunk" boxes where
        you will enter your R commands. The first thing you can do is to enter
        your name -replace "Your Name Here" with your own name, inside the
        quotes. Don't edit anything else in this block, the date will get added
        when you "knit" the file into a Word document.</p>
      <img src="rmd_name.png" alt="Name">
      <p>R commands go into code chunks, which are gray blocks between a line
        that starts with ```{r label}, and ends with ```, like so:</p>
      <img src="rmd_chunk.png" alt="Code chunk">
      <p>Once you have one or more lines of code in a chunk you can run it by
        hitting the green run button. The output will appear beneath the code
        chunks when they are executed if the command produces output (this
        example imports the data and puts it into an object called onesample, so
        it would not produce output). </p>
      <p>Questions are delimited with formatting symbols (**) that will make
        them render as bold italics, and below the questions there is a greater
        than sign (&gt;) where your answers should go so that they will be
        rendered as block quotes, like so:</p>
      <img src="rmd_answers.png" alt="Answers">
      <p>When you're done filling in the code chunks and answering the questions
        you will "knit" the markdown document into a Microsoft Word file, which
        will be a nicely formatted version of your document. It is this Word
        document you will upload to complete the assignment. The knit button is
        just under and to the right of the Rmd file's name, like so:</p>
      <img src="rmd_knit.png" alt="Knit">
      <p>Note: sometimes there will be commands you just need to try out and
        practice with, but aren't needed to answer the questions - I will tell
        you to enter those in the <strong>console</strong>. Every command
        should tell you whether to use the console or a code chunk, and most
        tell you which code chunk to use. Pay attention to where you're being
        directed to enter the commands so that you don't lose any work!</p>
      <p>If you then click on the "save" icon (the tiny floppy disk above the
        title) your changes will be saved in the review1.Rmd file.</p>
      <h3>Import the data into R</h3>
      <p>To get data into R for use, you need to download <a href="review_data.xlsx">this
          file</a>, called review_data.xlsx, into your project folder. Then, you
        can put the following command into your <strong>R markdown file</strong>
        (in the code chunk labeled "onesample.import.data", above the summary
        chunk you just completed):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(readxl)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;- read_excel("review_data.xlsx", sheet =
        "onesample")</p>
      <p>and execute it with the run button. You should now have an object
        called onesample in your Environment tab. The command we are using is
        called read_excel(), and it is found in an extension package (called a
        "library" in R terminology) called "readxl". We first load the library,
        and then use the read_excel() command within it to import the file. The
        review_data.xlsx file actually has five worksheets in it, called
        onesample, twosample, paired, anova, and regression, so we need to use
        sheet = "onesample" to let R know which sheet to import. The little
        makeshift arrow formed by the less than symbol and a dash is an <strong>assignment</strong>
        operator, which takes the output of read_excel() and assigns it to a new
        data set object we are calling onesample.</p>
      <h3>Fair warning: do not just copy and paste commands from this page into
        R</h3>
      <p>At this point some of you clever students may have already realized
        that you can just copy commands from these web pages into R and save
        yourself all kinds of time. The temptation to do this is great, but bear
        in mind that when you have to analyze data on your own this method won't
        be available, and R is fussy about command syntax. If you don't get any
        practice entering commands (and interpreting the often cryptic and
        unhelpful error messages R gives you when you make a mistake) you will
        have trouble when the time comes for you to do it on your own when I'm
        not available to help you (for example, on exams). Take your time and
        practice typing commands now, it's good for you.</p>

        <h2 id="objects_functions" class="part">Objects and functions</h2>
        <p>We are using R to statistically analyze our data, but it is also an <strong>object-oriented
            programming language</strong>. Object-oriented programming refers to
          an approach to writing computer programs that attempts to mimic the
          way that we interact with physical objects. Real, physical objects
          have <strong>properties</strong> that define them (volume, shape,
          mass). When we want to accomplish a task, the way we accomplish the
          same task is different depending on the type of object we'll use - for
          example, if we want to go to Los Angeles we will drive if we have a
          car, and will fly if we have a helicopter. Object orientation means
          that when we make a data set in R it has <strong> properties</strong>
          and <strong>methods</strong>. Properties are the characteristics of
          the data set, such as the number of rows and columns and their data
          types. Methods are the way a task is accomplished for that object
          type.</p>
        <p>To interact with an object, like our onesample data set, we can use <strong>functions</strong>.
          Most functions take arguments that tell them what to operate on and
          set options for how to operate, and all functions return results. A
          function in R will have a name followed by parentheses with no spaces
          between the name and the left (open) parenthesis. Functions will often
          have <strong>default</strong> settings for their arguments, and if
          the default settings are what you want you can accept them by leaving
          the arguments blank. For example, the ls() function is used to list
          the contents of a workspace, and if you just want to list the contents
          of the current workspace (the default) you just need to type (at the
          &gt; prompt in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
        <p class="rcmd">ls()</p>
        <p><strong></strong>and you'll see the output:</p>
        <p class="rout">[1] "onesample"</p>
        <p>The [1] is an index number that tells us that onesample is the first
          (and in this case, only) object in the workspace (listed
          alphabetically).</p>
        <p>We will use functions on our onesample object as well - to get a
          statistical summary of the body temperature in onesample, use the
          command:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">summary(onesample)</p>
        <p>which will display a summary in the Console window. You'll see that
          we use the same summary() command on different types of objects
          throughout the semester, and the same command produces different
          results for a data set than it does for other types of objects,
          because each type of object has its own summary method that it
          executes when summary() is used on it.</p>
        <p>One of the nice features of R Studio that you'll notice as you type
          this command is <strong>code completion</strong>. As you type R
          Studio will match what you've written already to lists of possible
          command and will give you a pop-up list of commands to choose from. If
          you select the command you want from the list (with up and down arrow
          keys) and then hit the TAB key the selection will be entered for you.
          This works with names of objects, and names of variables within
          objects as well. I recommend you take advantage of this feature,
          because one of the biggest frustrations in learning to use R is that
          it is very fussy about spelling, capitalization, and syntax of
          commands, and using code completion will help you avoid typos.</p>
        <p>Put this summary() command in the onesample.summary code chunk of
          your <strong>Rmd file</strong>.<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="one-sample_t" class="part">One-sample t-test</h2>
      <p>To review one-sample t-tests, you will test whether body temperature is
        different from 98.6 degrees. Imagine these data represent a set of body
        temperature measurements from a group of CSUSM students. Because you
        have a single sample of data, with a single mean body temperature, you
        will compare the mean of the data to a hypothetical value you specify
        using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>1. Check the assumptions of the test. If you recall, a one-sample
        t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed. We can check this
        using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test - it assumes the data are normally
        distributed as the null hypothesis, so a p-value over 0.05 indicates
        normality. Enter the following in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>,
        in the onesample.normality code chunk:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample$Body.temperature)</p>
      <p>The command is shapiro.test(), and it takes one argument, which is the
        variable that we want to test for normality. Note that we had to tell R
        both which data set to use, and which variable to use - if you tried
        shapiro.test(onesample) it would not work, even though there is only one
        variable, and if you tried shapiro.test(Body.temperature) it would not
        work because R wouldn't know which data set contained this variable,
        even though there is only one in the workspace. R is very literal.</p>
      <p>You'll see from the output of shapiro.test() that p is 0.1131, so we
        pass the normality assumption. </p>
      <p>This style of referring to a column in a data set - with the name of
        the data set followed by the name of the variable, separated by a dollar
        sign - is common, but not the only way available. We can refer to parts
        of a data set with a [row, column] index instead, like so (enter this in
        the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample[ , 1])</p>
      <p>Leaving the row number blank tells R to use all of the rows, but the 1
        in the column index tells R to use the first column in onesample for the
        test. Finally, we can use the with() command to identify the data set,
        and then nest the shapiro.test() command within it, like so (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(onesample, shapiro.test(Body.temperature))</p>
      <p>I personally prefer the first or third method, because it makes the
        commands easier to understand.</p>
      <p>2. Before conducting a one-sample t-test, look at your data! A good
        choice for small to medium sized data sets (100 observations or less) is
        a "dot plot", which plots the individual data points and stacks them up
        when they have the same data value (very much like a histogram, but with
        more detail preserved). </p>
      <p>R has <strong>base graphics</strong> that handle a lot of the graphing
        tasks we would want to do, but more recently an add-on library called <strong>ggplot2</strong>
        has been developed that is even more flexible and comprehensive. We will
        primarily use ggplot2 in this class.</p>
      <p>The ggplot() command works by first establishing the <strong>aesthetic
          mappings</strong>, which are the roles that variables will play in the
        graph, and then adding geometric elements (or geoms) to the graph that
        determine what it looks like.</p>
      <p>To make the dotplot, start with the command (in the onesample.dotplot
        code chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(onesample, aes(x = Body.temperature))</p>
      <p>If you run this you will get a blank set of axes, with Body.temperature
        on the x-axis. Before we can use ggplot() we need to load the library
        it's in; thus library(ggplot2) is entered first. The first argument to
        ggplot() is the name of the dataset, and the aesthetic mapping of the
        Body.temperature variable to the x-axis is done in the aes() statement.
      </p>
      <p>Now edit the command to add the geometric object for the dot plot
        (don't write a new command, just change it to read...):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(onesample, aes(x = Body.temperature)) +
        geom_dotplot()</p>
      <p>You should now have a plot that shows each individual data value along
        the x-axis, with the number of points that have the same data value
        shown on the y-axis.</p>
      <p>Another good type of graph to use to see the distribution of the data
        is a box plot, which you can get with (in the onesample.boxplot chunk of
        your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(onesample, aes(Body.temperature)) + geom_boxplot()</p>
      <p>Box plots show the smallest and largest non-extreme data values as <strong>whiskers</strong>,
        and three <strong>quartiles</strong> (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) as a box
        with a line in the middle. Quartiles are the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th
        percentiles, meaning that they are the values below which 25%, 50%, 75%,
        and 100% of the data values fall. The 2nd quartile is also called the
        median, and the 4th quartile is the maximum data value. The difference
        between the 3rd and 1st quartile is called the <strong>interquartile
          range</strong>, and if there are any data values that are more than
        1.5 times the interquartile range away from the bottom or top of the box
        they are considered <strong>extreme</strong> values. Extreme values are
        not necessarily errors, but they can cause problems for data analysis
        and boxplots flag them by plotting them with circles below the lower
        whisker or above the upper one. You can see there is one extreme value
        below the lower whisker, but none above, so the circle is the minimum,
        and the upper whisker is the maximum for the data set.</p>
      <p>3. Now you're ready to conduct the one-sample t-test. The command is
        (in onesample.ttest chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6)</p>
      <p>Output is reported in the console, and should look like <a href="onesample_output.png">this.</a></p>
      <p>This command requires a data set to work on, and a numeric value to
        compare the sample mean of the data against. Note that the data set is
        given as the first argument without any kind of identifier, but the
        second argument is identified as the value of the population mean (mu)
        that we want to use. R commands will have a default order for arguments,
        and if you put the arguments in the correct order you do not have to
        identify them. The mu option is actually the fourth argument in this
        command, but since there are some optional arguments that we aren't
        specifying we need to use the mu = label to tell R what 98.6 refers to.
        To avoid giving the name of the option we could use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, , , 98.6)</p>
      <p>and since 98.6 is the fourth argument, with the commas holding the
        places of the second and third, the t.test() command works without
        needing to name 98.6 as the mu argument.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the choices we need to make when we do hypothesis testing is
        whether we want to do one-tailed or two-tailed testing. If we do
        one-tailed testing we are only interested in detecting a difference in a
        particular direction - if we were measuring these temperatures to find
        out if people in the class are running a fever we would only be
        interested in whether the sample mean is higher than 98.6, and we may
        want to do a one-tailed test. If instead we're checking whether 98.6 is
        an accurate normal body temperature, then differences that are either
        above or below the mean are of interest, and we would use a two-tailed
        test. We specify whether we are doing a one-tailed or two-tailed test by
        specifying the alternative hypothesis - if we are only interested in
        testing for increases in body temperature we would use the command (in
        the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6, alternative
        = "greater")</p>
      <p>The default is to do two-tailed testing, so we don't need to specify an
        alternative if we are interested in differences that are either greater
        than or less than mu. </p>
      <p>If this distinction still does not make sense to you, read the review
        material on one-sample t-tests, linked at the top of the page.</p>
      <h2 id="two-sample_t" class="part">Two-sample t-test</h2>
      <p>Charles Darwin was not only an important theoretician, he conducted
        many experiments to test his ideas on evolution by natural selection. In
        the review_data.xls file, on the sheet called "twosample", you have some
        of Darwin's data on an experiment comparing the heights of a species of
        plant, the "mignonette", that can reproduce either by self-pollinating,
        or by using pollen from other individuals. Darwin experimentally
        self-pollinated some plants and crossed others, and collected the
        resulting seed. He then planted seeds from each pollination treatment
        group, and measured the heights of the offspring. </p>
      <p>You now have data from two different groups, and would like to know if
        their means are different enough to conclude they come from statistical
        populations with different means - remember, the sample means are almost
        certainly not identical, but that's not what we are testing (why would
        we test if the sample means are different when they obviously are not?).
        We are testing if the population means are different, given the amount
        of difference we find between between these two sample means.</p>
      <p>1. In your R markdown file enter the import command needed to import
        the sheet called "twosample" from the file "review_data.xls" into a data
        set called "twosample" (add this to your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).
        I won't give you the commands, start with the command you used above and
        modify it to work for the twosample worksheet. </p>
      <p>Once twosample is in your environment, click on it to open the data set
        for viewing.</p>
      <p>You'll see that we have two variables: <strong>Height</strong> (the
        height of the plants in cm) and <strong>Pollination</strong> (a
        grouping variable indicating if the plant was crossed or selfed). This
        arrangement of data, with groups indicated by a column called a
        "factor", is referred to as "stacked" data, and it's the arrangement we
        will use throughout the class.</p>
      <p>2. To make a dot plot of the height data grouped by pollination use the
        command (in the twosample.dot.plot chunk of your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(twosample, aes(x = Height)) + geom_dotplot() +
        facet_wrap(~Pollination, ncol = 1)</p>
      <p>The first parts of the command, ggplot() + geom_dotplot(), are the same
        as the previous example. We want to be able to compare the distributions
        of the data sets, so splitting them and putting them one above the other
        is done with the facet_wrap() command - we split the data using the
        Pollination variable, and the tilde (~) before it is used by R to
        specify functions (we will see the tilde frequently in R, it takes the
        place of an equal sign, =, in function definitions because the equal
        sign is an <strong>assignment operator</strong>, equivalent to &lt;-).</p>
      <p>To make a box plot for these data use the command (in the
        twosample.boxplot chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(twosample, aes(y = Height, x = Pollination)) +
        geom_boxplot() + labs(y = "Height (cm)")</p>
      <p>This command assigns the pollination group the the x-axis, which causes
        the graph to use a categorical x-axis with the cross and self groups
        identified - each box plot is plotted above its label. The final, new
        twist is that we labeled the y-axis with the labs() command, which
        assigned "Height (cm)" to the y-axis label.</p>
      <p>3. We need to test the data for normality, but we need to do this by
        group - if the two pollination types are have a different mean then the
        data may be bimodal when the groups are combined, even though they are
        normal when they are split.</p>
      <p>R is able to apply functions to subsets of data using the tapply()
        function. The tapply() function takes a column of data as its first
        argument, a grouping variable as its second argument, and a function to
        be applied to each group as the third. We can do Shapiro-Wilk tests on
        each pollination group with (in the twosample.normality chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, tapply(Height, Pollination, shapiro.test))</p>
      <p>You will see that R reports two different tests, one for each
        pollination group. We pass for both of them.</p>
      <p>4. Test the assumption of equal variances. Equal variances between
        groups is an assumption of the test, meaning that we can only trust our
        test of differences between the means to be accurate if we have equal
        variances (equal variances is not the biologically interesting question,
        therefore, we're just testing whether it's okay to use the t-test). </p>
      <p>To run Bartlett's test of homogeneity of variances (HOV) use the
        function (in the twosample.hov chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, bartlett.test(Height, Pollination))</p>
      <p>If you fail to reject that hypothesis (that is, if p &gt; 0.05),
        consider the variances the same. </p>
      <p>5. Now that we know that we meet the normality and HOV assumptions we
        can test for differences in mean height between groups. The same
        function is used, but with different arguments (in the twosample.ttest
        chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(Height ~ Pollination, var.equal = TRUE,
        data=twosample)</p>
      <p>This version of the t.test() function says that Height is a function of
        Pollination group, that the test should assume equal variances, and that
        the data set containing the variables is twosample.</p>
      <p>Note that in addition to the p-value, R reports a confidence
        interval&nbsp;the difference between the means. If it has a negative
        lower bound and a positive upper bound, the difference could be zero,
        and you would fail to reject the null. If it has two negative or two
        positive bounds, zero is not included in the interval, and you could
        reject the null.</p>
      <h2 id="paired_t" class="part">Paired t-test</h2>
      <p>A classic paired data set is one in which the same experimental
        subjects are observed in two different experimental conditions. You have
        data on plant CO2 uptake in two different ambient CO2 concentrations
        (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The goal is to compare the uptake between these
        two concentrations, but since each of 12 plants are tested at each
        concentration, we would expect the uptake values not to be independent,
        because uptake at 250 ppm and at 500 ppm are likely to be more similar
        for the same plant than for other plants in the data set. This causes
        two different problems: a) if we treat the observations as independent,
        we will use a greater degrees of freedom than we actually have, which
        will make our p-values inaccurate, and b) a small but consistent
        increase in uptake from 250 ppm to 500 ppm could be obscured by a large
        amount of variation among plants. We will use a paired t-test to correct
        for this lack of independence, and solve both of these problems.</p>
      <p>1. Import the sheet called "paired" into an R data set also called
        "paired" (put the needed command into your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>2. We should look at the data, but we have a small problem - our
        graphing commands want the data to be in a stacked arrangement, but
        these data are arranged side by side to facilitate the paired t-test we
        will do. Stacking the data would mean putting both sets of uptake values
        in a single column, with a second column that indicates the CO2
        treatment. R has a function that does this for us (enter in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3))</p>
      <p>This command takes the data set to be stacked as the first argument,
        and a <strong>vector</strong> of column numbers that should be stacked.
        Vectors are a single row or a single column of values, and R creates
        them using the c() command. The first column of the data set is just a
        plant ID label, which we don't need to plot, so we are just stacking the
        second and third columns. You'll see the result in the console.</p>
      <p>We have a small problem that we are only seeing the result in the
        console - a new data set is not created, because we didn't <strong>assign</strong>
        the result to a new object. We can fix this by recalling the command you
        just issued using the up arrow key, and then modifying the command like
        so (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3)) -&gt; co2.stacked</p>
      <p>The arrow formed with a dash followed by a greater than symbol is an <strong>assignment
          operator</strong> which causes R to take the output of the function on
        the left side and assign it to the new object on the right side. You can
        also assign from right to left by making the arrow point in the other
        direction, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">co2.stacked &lt;- stack(paired, c(2,3))</p>
      <p>When you assign output to an object it is not reported to the console,
        but you should now see an object called co2.stacked in your environment.
        To see it in the console you can write its name at the command prompt
        (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">co2.stacked</p>
      <p>and its contents will be displayed. If you click once on co2.stacked in
        the Environment tab it will open in a data viewer tab so you can scroll
        through the data.</p>
      <p>3. The column names are not very useful - stack() assigned the name
        "value" for the uptake data, and "ind" (short for "index") for the CO2
        treatment. We can use the command colnames() to extract the column names
        that are currently assigned (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked)</p>
      <p>which will display the column names in the console. We can also use
        colnames() to change the names to other values with the command (in the
        <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked) &lt;- c("Uptake", "Treatment")</p>
      <p>This command assigns a vector with "Uptake" and "Treatment" as the
        column names for co2.stacked. If you have the stacked data open in a
        viewer you'll see the column names update to these new values.</p>
      <p>Now, to make your <strong>R markdown</strong> file complete, put your
        stacking and renaming commands together into the paired.stack code
        chunk:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"><strong></strong>stack(paired, c(2,3)) -&gt; co2.stacked</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked) &lt;- c("Uptake", "Treatment")</p>
      <p>4. You now have a data set that you can use to make a dot plot and a
        box plot by group, so do so (in the appropriately named chunks of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>). You'll see that both of these plots show a
        small difference in the distribution of the data, but with lots of
        overlap. Remember, though, that the data are measurements of the same
        plants under two different CO2 concentrations, and the we're really only
        interested in whether each plant changes their CO2 uptake when the
        environment changes - we just need to know if the differences between
        plants are different from 0 on average.</p>
      <p>To get differences, we can use R's ability to operations on entire
        vectors of data - we can calculate differences between the two different
        CO2 treatments with the command (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250)</p>
      <p>The differences between each row of the paired data set is shown in the
        console. To add these differences back into the paired data set, recall
        the command and change it to (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250) -&gt; paired$diffs</p>
      <p>Your paired data set now has an additional column called "diffs",
        containing the differences. If you click on the data file name you'll
        see the new column. Add this final version of the command to the
        paired.diffs chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>.</p>
      <p>You can do a boxplot of these differences, and you'll see that all of
        them are positive (in the paired.diffs.boxplot chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>5. To check the normality assumption of a paired t-test, conduct a
        Shapiro-Wilk test on the differences you just calculated (in the
        paired.diffs.normality chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>6. Now that you know you meet the normality assumption, conduct a
        paired t-test using the same function, but with different options (in
        the paired.ttest chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, t.test(uptake_250, uptake_500, paired =
        TRUE)) </p>
      <p>The paired t-test compares the mean of the differences between the two
        columns of data against 0, using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>Note that since we calculated the differences for plotting and to check
        normality we could just as easily have done this analysis as a
        one-sample t-test. In the <strong>console</strong> see if you can do a
        one-sample t-test on the diffs, and confirm that the results are the
        same as you obtained using the paired t-test (same df, same t-value,
        same p-value).</p>
      <h2>Knit the output file</h2>
      <p>When you are done with the exercise, your R markdown file can be "knit"
        into a Microsoft Word document, that shows all the code you used, and
        all the output, formatted nicely into a report. You can open the file,
        edit it, annotate it if you like, and it will be this file you upload to
        complete the assignment.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is to find the "Knit" button above the R markdown
        window, <img src="knit.png">. Clicking this once will create the
        default Word document (which is specified in the header of your markdown
        file), but if you click and hold you'll see that you can use the same
        markdown file to make other types of files, such as a web page (html),
        or a pdf document.</p>
      <p>You want a Word file though, so click once to create it. When the
        process is complete you will have a file called review1.docx in your
        project folder. RStudio will also open Word so you can see the document
        - it's very pretty.</p>
      <p>Upload this review1.docx file to the course web site to complete the
        assignment.</p>
      <h2 id="r_help" class="part">Additional help with R</h2>
      <p>There are several good, free tutorials on R. A good place to look for
        them is the CRAN web site - go to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</a>,
        and find the "Documentation" links on the left side of the page. The
        "Manuals" are meant as complete references, but are not written as
        tutorials. The "Contributed" documentation section gives several good
        introductory documents that you can check out. Some particularly newbie
        friendly ones are "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf">R
          for Beginners</a>", and "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lemon-kickstart/index.html">Kickstarting
          R</a>". Another good, fairly comprehensive document that uses
        biological examples is "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Seefeld_StatsRBio.pdf">Statistics
using
          biological examples</a>".</p>
      <p> The graphical interface we're using, R Commander, is a "contributed
        package" that isn't a standard part of R. Consequently, it will most
        likely not appear in the tutorials linked above. If you want to learn
        more about how to use it, you can try "<a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/Getting-Started-with-the-Rcmdr.pdf">Getting
Started
          with the R Commander</a>" (written by the guy who programmed R
        Commander), or possibly "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Karp-Rcommander-intro.pdf">R
          Commander: An Introduction</a>" (written by some other person).</p>

      <p>If you like actual dead-tree books better, there is now an "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/R-For-Dummies-Joris-Meys/dp/1119962846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346342674&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=r+for+dummies">R
          for Dummies</a>" book (if your pride allows it). A couple other good
        options include "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-R-Computing/dp/0387790535/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346342674&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=r+for+dummies">Introductory

          Beginner's Guide to R</a>", which cover similar ground as the Dummies
        book without requiring you to eat humble pie. Finally, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nutshell-Desktop-Quick-Reference/dp/059680170X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346342674&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=r+for+dummies">R
          in a Nutshell</a>" is a good reference, but with less emphasis on
        teaching.</p>
