    <h1>Spreadsheet equations - a very brief introduction</h1>
    <p>Spreadsheets like Excel are more than just convenient ways of entering
      and storing data, they are remarkably capable calculators. In addition to
      entering text or numbers in a spreadsheet cell, you can enter an equation
      to perform some function, such as:</p>
    <span class="Excel">=2+3</span><br>
    <p>The equals sign is used to tell Excel that this is an equation, rather
      than just a string of text. When you hit enter, you will see the result of
      this calculation displayed in the cell, and the formula will be displayed
      in the formula bar at the top of the worksheet.</p>
    <p> Another way to calculate 2+3 is to enter the numbers into cells in the
      worksheet, and then use "cell references" in a formula, like so:</p>
    <img style="width: 238px; height: 122px;" alt="Cell ref" src="cell_reference.jpg"><br>
    <p> Here, the numbers are in cells A2 and A3, and we enter an equation in
      cell C2 that refers to the cells where the numbers are stored, rather than
      using the numbers themselves. Why do this? The first reason is that if we
      decide we didn't really mean to add 2+3, but rather meant to add 4+3, we
      can just change the value in cell A2 to 4, and the formula will update
      automatically. This is a trivial example with only two numbers, but if you
      had hundreds of numbers you were working with it would be nice to be able
      to correct mistakes in the data without having to change the equations.
      Another good reason for using equations is that the cell references are
      "relative" to the position of the equation, and if you copy and paste the
      equation down two rows, the cell references will increase by two to
      reflect the change. For example:</p>
    <img style="width: 268px; height: 229px;" alt="Copy and paste a formula" src="cell_reference2.jpg"><br>
    <p>Two additional numbers have been entered, in cells A8 and A9. Since there
      was already a formula in the worksheet for adding two numbers in adjacent
      rows, we can copy that formula from cell C2 and paste it in cell C8. When
      the equation is pasted into cell C8, it updates the cell references to
      reflect that the equation is now six rows lower in the sheet, and the
      formula in C8 is thus automatically changed to =A8+A9. This is
      tremendously useful, because it means that once you have a formula entered
      correctly, you can copy and paste it to other locations as needed.</p>
    <p>Basic mathematical operations are done in Excel using the following
      symbols:</p>
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 514px; height: 166px;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
      cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Operation</td>
          <td>Symbol</td>
          <td>Example</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Addition</td>
          <td>+</td>
          <td>=2+3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Subtraction</td>
          <td>-</td>
          <td>=2-3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Multiplication</td>
          <td>*</td>
          <td>=2*3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Division</td>
          <td>/</td>
          <td>=2/3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Exponents</td>
          <td>^</td>
          <td>=2^3</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p> Hopefully you remember from your math classes that n'th roots are the
      same as raising a number to the 1/n'th power - thus, you can calculate the
      square root of a number with:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =2^(1/2)</span><br>
    <p> Parentheses are used to group operations, and dictate the order -
      operations are done within the parentheses first.</p>
    <p> Another way to do math in Excel is to use built-in functions. For
      example, rather than using:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =A2+A3</span><br>
    <p> in our example above, we could have used:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =sum(A2,A3)</span><br>
    <p> Functions always have a pair of parentheses next to them, with no space
      between the name of the function and the left parentheses. Anything within
      the parentheses is called an "argument" for the function, and arguments
      can either be the data on which the function will operate (as with our
      sum() function), or some other piece of information that the function
      needs in order to operate properly. As written, the sum() function is
      given two arguments, the cells that contain the data, separated by a
      comma. Arguments are always separated by commas in Excel (other
      spreadsheets may use other characters). With only two numbers to sum this
      is a fine way to specify the arguments, but if we had many numbers a more
      compact way would be:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =sum(A2:A300)</span><br>
    <p> In this case, we are telling the sum() function to add up any values in
      cell A2, A300, and all the cells in between. Using a colon to separate the
      cells tells Excel to include all the cells between the two that are named.
      This syntax can be used to specify rectangular regions on the spreadsheet
      as well. For example, if we had used:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =sum(A2:B300)</span><br>
    <p> we would have summed all the numbers in column A from row 2 to 300, as
      well as all the numbers in column B from row 2 to 300.</p>
    <p> To return to the spreadsheet equation for the binomial distribution:</p>
    <span class="Excel"> =binomdist(number of females, clutch size, probability
      of female, cumulative)</span><br>
    <p> There are four arguments for this function, which I've translated for
      you as the number of females ("number_s" to Excel), clutch size ("trials"
      to Excel), probability of female ("probability_s" to excel), and
      cumulative (also "cumulative" to Excel). Excel only knows which argument
      is which based on the order they appear, so be sure to enter your values
      in the right place! To calculate the probability of 4 females in a clutch
      size of 4 with a probability of female of 0.17 (for "High" temperatures),
      you would enter in cell F9:</p>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 718px; height: 214px;" alt="Binom dist" src="cell_reference3.jpg"><br>
    <p> assuming that A9 is the cell indicating a "4" for four females (your
      pivot table may be a little different - use the correct cell for your
      table). &nbsp;The final argument, "cumulative", is set to 0 if you just
      want to know the probability of getting 4 females, or set to 1 if you want
      to know the probability of getting any number of females up to 4 (that is,
      0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).</p>
    <p> Using cell references for the first argument is very handy, because now
      it's possible to copy and paste the cells to the rest of the rows of the
      table to get probabilities for the other outcomes. If you select the cell
      F9, copy it, and then paste it to F5 through F8, you will get this:</p>
    <img style="width: 636px; height: 160px;" alt="Copy and paste" src="cell_reference4.jpg"><br>
    <p> When the cells are pasted, the references are updated to point to their
      own rows, which has the effect of calculating the probabilities for the
      remaining numbers of females. The cells F5 through F9 now give the
      probabilities of each possible number of females in a clutch of four. </p>
    <p> Be careful, though - if you then decide to really save yourself some
      hassles and copy and paste to the next column over to do the "Low"
      temperatures, be aware that the cell reference will now point to one
      column over as well, and you will be pointing to B5 through B9, instead of
      A5 through A9. Make sure that when you paste your equations that their
      cell references are pointing to the right place!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><a name="SpreadsheetEquations"></a>Cell equations are tremendously
      useful, and Excel has dozens of them. Just as a small example, there are
      functions for:</p>
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 516px; height: 139px;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
      cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Mean</td>
          <td><span class="Excel">=average(data range)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Median</td>
          <td><span class="Excel">=median(data range)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Standard deviation</td>
          <td><span class="Excel">=stdev(data range)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Variance</td>
          <td><span class="Excel">=var(data range)</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Square root</td>
          <td><span class="Excel">=sqrt(value)</span></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>as well as many more complex statistical functions we may encounter later
      in the semester.</p>
