      <h2 class="part" id="freqs">Frequencies of levels of a categorical
        variable</h2>
      <p> When we encountered categorical variables in two sample t-tests or
        ANOVA they were the treatment groups we wanted to compare - for example,
        the heart rates of lobsters were compared between GABA-treated and
        control groups, which we represented as a variable "Treatment" with
        levels "GABA" and "Control. In a t-test or ANOVA the categorical
        variable is a <strong>predictor</strong> variables - it is the variable
        we experimentally set, so that we can measure another variable (such as
        heart rate) as a <strong>response</strong>. </p>
      <p>However, it is possible for response variables to be categorical as
        well. We summarize categorical variables by counting up <strong>frequencies</strong>
        of occurrence of each level, which gives us a set of counts that we can
        analyze. </p>
      <p>Today we will focus here on frequencies of just a single categorical
        variable at a time, and we will ask how the distribution of frequencies
        compares with some hypothetical sets of frequencies of interest. In this
        sense the question we'll ask is like a one-sample t-test, in which we
        hypothesized a population mean (such as body temperature of 98.6
        degrees) and then compared the mean of some data on body temperatures to
        the hypothetical population value. With categorical frequencies we will
        need to specify a different hypothetical value for each categorical
        level.</p>
      <p> Imagine you are interested in studying the distribution of head
        injuries in high school athletes participating in various sports in the
        United States. Data showing the number of concussions are in the table
        below.</p>

          <p>It is clear from this table that football players get the most
            concussions by far, and baseball players get the fewest. It seems
            that football is the most dangerous and baseball is the least
            dangerous sport based on these numbers. But, is it valid to draw a
            conclusion by just comparing the numbers of concussions between the
            sports?</p>
          <p>The problem with direct comparisons like this is that it's likely
            that a different number of students participate in each sport. It's
            possible that more students participate in football than other
            sports, in which case we would expect more concussions for football
            players, even if the chances of a concussion are the same on a
            per-student basis.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p style="clear:both">To make a more reasonable assessment, we need a
        baseline that gives an idea of how many concussions to expect if all of
        the sports are equally dangerous. One way to do this is to use data on
        number of participants - if sports are all equally dangerous then we
        would expect concussions to be in proportion to the number of
        participants.</p>

          <p> You'll see now that the numbers of concussions could very easily
            be influenced by the number of students participating in each sport,
            because the numbers of participants vary greatly. Football does
            indeed have the most participants, and the two seemingly safe sports
            (lacrosse and baseball) have fewer.</p>
          <p> So, at least some of the variation in concussions seems to be due
            to differences in participation rates. However, we don't expect the
            number of concussions to equal the number of participants, because
            the totals are different. First, we need to calculate the number of
            concussions we would <strong>expect</strong> given the numbers of
            students participating in each sport.</p>

        <p>The first step in calculating the expected frequencies of concussions
          is to convert the frequencies of participants to <strong>relative
            frequencies</strong>. If you recall, relative frequencies are
          proportions of the total number of observations. The relative
          frequencies for each sport are shown to the left (Proportion of
          students participating), which are calculate by dividing the number of
          participants in each sport by the total participants. </p>
        <p>These proportions tell us the rate at which we would expect
          concussions to occur, if each sport is equally dangerous and
          concussions are in proportion to participation. In other words, if all
          the sports were equally dangerous we would expect 23.3% of concussions
          to occur in basketball players, 31.9% to occur in football players,
          etc.</p>

        <p>Now we can calculate the <strong>expected frequency</strong> of
          concussions by multiplying the total number of concussions (100,967)
          by the proportion of students participating in each sport. For
          example, since 23.3% of the 100,967 concussions are expected to occur
          in basketball players, the expected frequency is 0.233 x 100,967 =
          23,525.3. Expected frequencies for all of the sports are shown in
          boldface, with the calculations in gray.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="clear: both">You'll see that the total is the same for the
        observed number of concussions and for the expected number of
        concussions, so now we have numbers that we can appropriately compare
        against each other.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>The frequency of concussions and their expected frequencies are shown
        below, with observed numbers of concussions in blue, and the expected
        number in red. It certainly looks like football is more dangerous than
        the other sports, as it's the only sport in which the observed frequency
        is greater than expected.</p>
      <h3>The null hypothesis</h3>
      <div id="wrapper_div" style="float: left; border: solid black 4px; margin-right: 10px; width: 500px;">
        <div id="chart_div" style="width: 500; height: 400px;"></div>
        <button type="button" id="just_randomize" onclick="updateChart1()">Randomize</button><button
          type="button" id="reset" onclick="resetChart1()">Reset</button> </div>
      <p>But before we jump to conclusion we have to remember that these data
        are a sample from a population, and the frequencies are subject to
        random variation. We need to know these frequencies are affected by
        random variation to understand the <strong>null hypothesis</strong> we
        will use. The graph to the left will simulate the frequencies of
        concussions that we would expect if concussions were proportional to
        participation rates, subject to random sampling.</p>
      <p>If you push the "randomize" button a new set of 100,967 concussions are
        selected, with the probability of occurring in each type of sport being
        equal to the proportion of students participating.</p>
      <p>The first thing you'll see is the obvious change from observed
        frequencies - the new "observed" numbers that you generated at random
        match very closely to the expected numbers of concussions. But, there
        are slight differences still between observed and expected numbers due
        to random sampling. If you click the "Randomize" button repeatedly (and
        watch the bar heights closely) you'll see that the blue bars change very
        slightly each time as a new "observed" sample is selected. Note also
        that the red expected numbers are always the same, because each
        randomization uses the same total number of concussions.</p>
      <p>Random distributions of concussions in proportion to the frequency of
        participants is a <strong>null hypothesis</strong> for these data. Null
        hypotheses are always hypotheses of no effect - if there is no effect of
        being in one sport or another, then the frequency of concussions should
        be in proportion to the frequency of participants. To evaluate the
        chances that the distribution of concussions is just a random sample
        from a population in which all of the sports are equally dangerous, we
        need a way to quantify how much difference there is between the set of
        observed frequencies and the set of expected frequencies, and then
        calculate a probability of the observed difference occurring by random
        chance.</p>
      <p>The statistical test we will use to evaluate this null hypothesis is
        called a <strong>Chi-square goodness of fit test</strong>.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="chisquare_gof" style="clear:both">Chi-square goodness
        of fit tests</h2>
      <p>Chi-square goodness of fit tests are used to compare the match between
        observed frequencies and values expected given some process that is
        hypothesized to be producing them. We can express our null hypothesis
        that our observed data are in proportion to expected frequencies
        symbolically as: </p>
      <p> Ho: Observed = Expected</p>
      <p>Although we don't have Greek letters to remind us, this is still a
        hypothesis about a population - we're hypothesizing that at the
        population level the distribution of concussions is equal to the
        expected rates. If the null hypothesis is true, any difference between
        observed and expected is just due to random sampling variation. </p>
      <p>To test a null hypothesis, we need a) an observed test statistic
        calculated from our data, and b) a sampling distribution that tells us
        what a large number of randomly generated test statistics would look
        like if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
      <h3>Test statistic</h3>
      <p>We will use the Pearson Chi-square test statistic to measure the amount
        of difference between observed and expected numbers. The formula is:</p>
      <p> <img src="chisq_formula.jpg" style="width: 105px; height: 41px;" alt="Chisq formula"></p>
      <p>where O refers to the observed number of concussions for a sport, and E
        refers to the expected number. The (O-E)<sup>2</sup>/E quantity is
        calculated for each sport, then summed (Σ) across sports to give us our
        observed chi-square value. The standard symbol for a Chi-squared test
        statistic is lower case Greek chi (χ) squared. </p>
      <p>If you look at the formula, it should be clear that the statistic is
        measuring the amount of difference between observed and expected
        frequencies. You can tell this from the formula if you notice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If there is an exact match between the observed data and the
          expected values, then all of the O-E differences will be 0, and the
          Chi-square statistic will be 0. Since expected values have to be
          positive, and squared differences have to be positive, negative values
          aren't possible, and 0 is the smallest possible value for χ<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <li>As the observed frequencies diverge from expected values, the O-E's
          get bigger, and the Chi-square statistic will increase in size.</li>
        <li>The squared differences are being divided by expected values - this
          means that the amount of difference between observed and expected is
          relative to the expected numbers. Thus, the Chi-square statistic
          measures relative amounts of difference between observed and expected,
          not absolute amounts of difference.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style=" clear:both">Sampling distribution</h3>
      <p style="clear:both">Now we need a sampling distribution to compare this
        test statistic to so that we can obtain a p-value. Remember, sampling
        distributions are probability distributions that mathematically model
        randomly sampling from a population. In this case, the random sampling
        we are modeling is illustrated in the graph above when you hit the
        "Randomize" button - the random samples assume that the null is true,
        and that concussions are in proportion to participation rates, but
        random chance makes the observed frequencies differ somewhat from these
        expected proportions. If we calculated a Chi-square statistic for each
        of the random samples generated, the distribution of these statistics
        would follow a <strong>Chi-square distribution</strong>. We can thus
        use the Chi-square probability distribution as a mathematical model of
        random sampling for our null hypothesis test.</p>
      <p>A Chi-square distribution is shown in the graph below, with the
        rejection region for a Chi-square GOF test shaded red - just like with
        the other tests we've learned we use an alpha level of 0.05, so the area
        under the curve in the rejection region is 0.05. Since the Chi-square
        statistic uses squared differences it will always be positive, and since
        we are interested in whether deviations are large enough to be
        considered non-random we are only interested in the upper end of the
        curve. The critical value is the lower end of the rejection region, and
        is reported below the degrees of freedom setting.</p>
      <div id="wrapper_div3" style="float: left; border: solid black 4px; margin-right: 10px; width: 400px;">

        <p>Enter d.f. (categories - 1): <input id="chisq_df" value="4" onchange="drawChart3()"
            style="width: 50px" min="1" type="number"></p>
        <p>Critical value = <span id="chi_crit">9.488</span></p>
      </div>
      <p>The shape of a Chi-square distribution depends on degrees of freedom.
        We are comparing observed to expected frequencies for <em>five sports</em>,
        so degrees of freedom is related to the number of sports, not the number
        of athletes. In a Chi-square goodness of fit test degrees of freedom
        equals the number of categories - 1. We have five sports, so there 5 - 1
        = 4 degrees of freedom for these data.</p>
      <p>The graph to the left is set initially to 4 degrees of freedom so you
        can see the distribution we will use for this analysis of concussion
        rates. The critical value for 4 degrees of freedom is Chi-square =
        9.488, so we would reject the null with any Chi-square value greater
        than that.</p>
      <p>You can change the degrees of freedom for the graph so you can see how
        the shape of the Chi-square distribution and location of the critical
        value changes. If you increase degrees of freedom the curve shifts to
        the right (note that the x-axis scale changes to keep the curve on the
        graph). This shift right reflects the fact that we're summing squared
        differences across categories, and with each additional categories there
        is an additional squared difference to add to the Chi-square statistic.
        Small differences become very unlikely as the number of categories
        increases, and a perfect match (Chi-square = 0) has a probability of 0.
      </p>
      <p>Decreasing degrees of freedom shifts the curve back to the left,
        because small numbers of categories provide few opportunities for
        differences to accumulate. If you set degrees of freedom to 1 you'll see
        that large differences become very unlikely, and small differences are
        so common that the curve becomes asymptotic with the y-axis. This means
        that at 1 df the most probable amount of random difference is 0, with
        differences quickly becoming less probable as they increase in size. </p>
      <p>At df = 2 the curve isn't an asymptote, but it increases at low numbers
        until it intersects the y-axis at p = 0.5. </p>
      <p>At df = 3 or above the curve goes through the origin (0,0) and becomes
        a right-skewed curve with a single mode near a χ<sup>2</sup> value of 1,
        meaning that differences of 0 become impossible, and Chi-square values
        of around 1 become the most likely.</p>
      <h3>p-value</h3>
      <p>Now that we have the correct Chi-square distribution identified we can
        calculate a p-value. The observed chi-square statistic is 46,086, and
        the area under the Chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom
        from 46,086 to infinity is...tiny. If we use MINITAB or Excel to do the
        calculation we will get a p-value like 1 x 10<sup>-16</sup>, which is
        the smallest decimal number that it can produce.&nbsp; Based on this
        p-value we would <strong>reject</strong> the null, and conclude that
        the observed data aren't equal to expected, and therefore concussions
        are not in proportion to participation rates.</p>
      <p>We now have reason to think that some sports are more dangerous than
        others, but the null hypothesis is about a match between observed and
        expected frequencies collectively, and rejecting the hypothesis doesn't
        tell us which sports produce significantly more or less concussions than
        expected. We will address that question next.<span style="font-family: &quot;Crimson Text&quot;,serif;"><br>
        </span></p>
      <h2 class="part" id="resids">Which sport is most dangerous?</h2>
      <p>We can get an idea of which sport is most dangerous just by comparing
        the observed and expected values - football is the only sport in this
        set that has more concussions than expected. However, comparing the
        amount of difference between observed and expected values between the
        sports is complicated by the fact that the expected numbers are really
        different among the sports. Lacrosse has an expected value of 4139.6
        concussions, so it isn't possible for lacrosse to be under its expected
        value by more than 4139.6. Both baseball and basketball are below their
        expected values by more than this, but there are many more students that
        participate in these sports, and they have much higher expected values
        to begin with. If we wanted to know whether lacrosse was more or less
        safe than baseball or basketball we would need to account for the
        differences in numbers of participants.</p>
      <p>We can correct for this difference in expected value by calculating <strong>standardized
          residuals</strong> that give us a relative amount of difference from
        expected that can be compared between the sports. We encountered
        residuals when we learned about regression analysis - residuals are
        differences between observed and predicted values. Standardizing means
        to convert the difference into standard deviation units, like a z-score.
        A standardized residual in a Chi-square GOF analysis is calculated as:</p>
      <p> <img style="width: 59px; height: 41px;" alt="Standardized residual" src="std_resid.jpg"></p>
      <p> The structure is like the chi-square formula, but we are only
        calculating a value for one sport at a time, and instead of squaring the
        differences (which ensures we will always have positive chi-square
        values) we use the raw difference in the numerator and divide by the
        square root of the expected - standardized residuals thus have a sign
        that indicate whether the observed value was above (+) or below (-)
        expected. Standardized residuals are approximately normally distributed,
        so a standardized residual that exceeds -2 or 2 indicates an observed
        value that is significantly different from expected. The standardized
        residuals are here:</p>

            observed number of concussions is 168 standard deviations above the
            expected value. The least likely to produce a concussion is baseball
            (it has the negative standardized residual with the biggest absolute
            value), but basketball is only 2 standard deviations closer to its
            expected value - only slightly more dangerous than baseball. Soccer

      <h3 class="part" id="power" style="clear:both">Effects of sample size on
        power of a Chi-square test</h3>
      <p>The number of data points isn't used explicitly anywhere in the
        Chi-square goodness of fit test. This is very different than the other
        tests we used, in which degrees of freedom were based on the number of
        data points, and larger sample sizes had obvious effects on the power of
        the test. It might seem almost unfair to collect over 100,000 data
        points and still only have 4 degrees of freedom, but fear not - having a
        bigger sample size does in fact increase our power to detect differences
        from expected values.</p>
      <p>We will see how this is true by revisiting the simulation of the null
        hypothesis we saw above, but this time we have the ability to set the
        sample size. As before, we can randomize the data at the sample size we
        select, and each time we will see the results of the Chi-square goodness
        of fit test.</p>

          at this n</button> </div>
      <p>We will just work with randomly generated data this time -
        since the "observed" frequencies are being randomly generated assuming
        that concussion rates are the same for all sports, the null hypothesis
        is true in all of these simulations.</p>
      <p>We can only be certain that our results show a real, non-random
        difference if it's bigger than the differences that chance can produce.
        Because of this, if our design allows for large differences to occur by
        chance, we would need even bigger differences in our observed data
        before we could conclude that there is a real, non-random difference.
        Which is to say, big chance differences mean lower statistical power,
        and small chance differences mean high statistical power.</p>
      <p>To start, leave the sample size at the default and click on the
        "Randomize at this n" button several times. Note that about once every
        20 times you click the button you get a p value less than 0.05, which is
        what we expect when the null hypothesis is true (the p-value will turn
        red when it is less than 0.05). But, also note that the relative
        differences between the bars are very small - each time you hit the
        "Randomize at this n" button a new set of random data is produced, but
        the heights of the bars are always very close together. Pay particularly
        close attention to the amount of difference you see when you do get a p
        &lt; 0.05 - this is the amount of difference needed to reject the null,
        and the observed bars are still pretty close to the expected bars <em>even
          when we reject the null</em>.</p>
      <p>Now, set the sample size to 1000. You will see that there are larger
        differences in the heights of the bars with each new random draw. You
        will still get about 1 in 20 p-values less than 0.05, but when you get
        them the amount of relative difference between the heights of the bars
        will be bigger than you saw at a sample size of 100,967. This means that
        you need a larger relative difference between observed and expected to
        reject the null at a sample size of 1000 than you needed at a sample
        size of 100,967.</p>
      <p>Drop the sample size again to 100, and it will be even more clear that
        there are pretty big relative differences between observed and expected
        when p-values are less than 0.05. You need pretty big relative
        differences at a sample size of 100 to reject the null.</p>
      <p>Hopefully you can see that at big sample sizes small relative
        differences between observed and expected can be statistically
        significant - the Chi-square test becomes more sensitive to small
        differences at big sample sizes, even though the degrees of freedom are
        the same for all sample sizes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2 class="part" id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
      <p>Chi-square goodness of fit tests are used on frequencies of categorical
        data, and do not have any assumptions about the distribution of the
        data. It is assumed that the data values are independent, and are from a
        random sample of the population. Independence in count data like this
        means that one athlete's concussion doesn't make it any more or less
        likely that any other athlete will get a concussion (as you'll see in
        the bees and hummingbirds as pollinators example we are sometimes
        interested in detection a violation of this assumption as a research
        question).</p>
      <p>The Chi-square test statistic we use is more correctly called Pearson's
        Chi-square test statistic, and it only follows the Chi-square
        distribution at fairly large sample sizes. The problem is related to the
        fact that the expected values are continuous numbers, but the data are
        discrete counts. There will inevitably be some amount of mismatch
        between observed and expected because of this, which adds some error to
        the test.</p>
      <p>The problem is small and can be ignored when sample sizes are big
        enough that the expected values are fairly large, but at small sample
        sizes the error can be quite large. For example, if we have an expected
        value of 0.1, the two closest counts possible are 0 and 1. If the count
        was 0, the contribution to the Chi-square statistic would be (0-0.1)<sup>2</sup>/0.1
        = 0.1 - a very small addition to Chi-square. But, if the count was the
        second closest possible, the contribution becomes (1-0.1)<sup>2</sup>/0.1
        = 8.1 - a much bigger addition to Chi-square for a small amount of
        difference.</p>
      <p>To avoid problems with mismatches between the variable type for the
        data and for the expected values, the Pearson Chi-square statistic
        should only be used if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No expected values are below 1</li>
        <li>No more than 20% of expected values are less than 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With 5 categories, only 1 could have an expected value less than 5 (but
        it would still need to be greater than 1).</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="sources_expected">Interpretation of results depends
        on the source of expected values</h2>
      <p>When we test for goodness of fit, we are assessing how well a model
        matches our data. The proportional model we've been working with so far
        says that there is a rate per observation that is the same for every
        category. In the concussion example, the concussion rate is the same for
        every student, regardless of the sport. If this is true, then the
        numbers of concussions should be proportional to the number of
        participants, because every sport is equally risky.</p>
      <p>The basic framework for interpreting a goodness of fit test is the
        same, regardless of what model we use to produce expected frequencies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we find a good match between observed frequencies and the
          expected frequencies produced by a model, we conclude that <em>the
            data have the properties of the model</em> - if concussions were in
          proportion to participation, we would conclude that every sport is
          equally risky. </li>

              <p>Imagine we found 1000 families of 4 kids, and counted up how
                many boys were in each of them. If we then counted up the
                frequencies of each number of boys we might get a distribution
                of frequencies like the one on the left. The x-axis gives the
                number of boys counted (which in a family of 4 could be 0, 1, 2,
                3, or 4 boys), and the y-axis is the number of families that had
                each number of boys.</p>
              <p>We know some things about sex determination, and based on the
                fact that when sperm cells are formed there are an equal number
                of Y and X chromosomes available it's reasonable to think that
                the probability of having a boy is 1/2. We would expect based on
                this that two boys would be the most common number, which is
                what we see here. But, how many times would we expect 1 boy, or
                3? Or 0 or 4? With a probability of 0.5 that each child will be
                a boy it seems that having 1 or 3 would be more likely than
                having 0 or 4, but how much more likely?</p>
              <p>In addition to needing a way to predict how many families would
                have each of the possible number of boys, we also could be wrong
                in our expectation that the probability of each child being a
                boy is 0.5 is wrong - certainly, the overall proportion of boys
                may be different from 1/2 if Y sperm are either better or worse
                at fertilizing eggs. Or, it could be that boys have higher or
                lower survival rates than girls.</p>

      <p>We need something other than the proportional model for data like
        these, and the <strong>binomial probability distribution</strong> is a
        much better choice. The binomial distribution allows us take what we
        know about the probability of a "success" on a single "trial" and
        predict the probability of obtaining x successes out of k trials.</p>
      <p>For example, if we want to know the probability of x males (successes)
        in a family of 4 kids (trials) given that the probability of a male is
        1/2, we can calculate this probability using the binomial distribution.</p>
      <p>The formula for calculating binomial probabilities looks complicated,
        but is actually relatively simple:</p>
      <p><img src="binom_formula.jpg" name="graphics15" alt="formula" width="180"
          height="44" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
      <p>In this equation, k is the number of trials - k is the family size for
        our data, which is 4. The number of "successes" is x - in our example x
        is the number of male births (note: "trials" and "successes" are
        traditional terminology for the binomial distribution, and are not meant
        to imply that male births are "successes" and female births are
        "failures"). The probability of a male child for each birth is p - in
        our example, we set p to 0.5. The probability of a female birth is 1-p,
        and k-x is the number of females in the family. We need to include (1-p)
        and k-x because in order to have (for example) two males out of four
        births we also have to have two females. </p>
      <p>We are expecting that 2 males out of 4 births will be the most common
        when p = 0.5, and according to the binomial distribution the probability
        of 2 boys out of 4 kids is:</p>
      <p><img src="binom_formula2.jpg" name="graphics16" alt="binom with numbers"
          width="197" height="44" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
      <p>which you can confirm for yourself equals 0.38.</p>
      <p>You can think of this formula as being made up of two parts. The part
        on the right, with the probabilities raised to exponents, gives the
        probability of a single family of four having two boys and two girls.
        This outcome can occur in many different ways (you can have a boy and a
        boy and a girl and a girl, or a boy and a girl and a boy and a girl,
        etc.), and to get the overall probability of getting two boys and two
        girls, we have to add up all the different ways this family composition
        can occur. The part on the left, with the factorials, calculates the
        number of different ways to get two boys in a family of four. The
        product of the two, then, gives the overall probability of getting two
        boys in a family of four.</p>

      <p>If you do this probability calculation once for each number of males
        from 0 to 4, you get probabilities as shown in the graph to the left.</p>
      <p>The initial graph uses a probability of p = 0.5, and it shows a
        symmetrical distribution of probabilities around 2.</p>
      <p>We will continue to use p = 0.5 for this example, but this actually
        isn't quite correct, especially as we age. Men have shorter life
        expectancies than women, such that in the U.S. there are only 82 males
        per 100 female for people between 65 and 69 years old. This is equal to
        a probability of male of p = 82/(82+100) = 0.45. Think of this as being
        the probability of randomly selecting a single person between 65 and 69
        years old who is a male. You can see how this value of p affects the
        shape of the distribution.</p>
      <p>Between the ages of 95 and 99 there are only 26 males per 100 females.
        This translates into a probability of p = 26/(26+100) = 0.206 - check
        how this value of p changes the distribution.</p>
      <p>If you change the family size you'll see that as long as p is set to
        0.5 you get a symmetrical distribution. Large numbers for family size
        make the distribution more bell-shaped, to the point of appearing nearly
        normal when the family size gets really large.</p>
      <p>If you set the probability to 0.5 and the family size to 4 the graph
        will match the binomial probabilities used in the next step.</p>
      <p style="position: block; clear:both">Multiplying the binomial
        probabilities by the total number of families counted converts them to
        expected numbers of families that would have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 boys.</p>
      <p><img alt="Chisquare" src="chisq_kids.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">The
        Frequency column are the counts of numbers of families with each number
        of boys - it is the observed data. The binomial probabilities are
        calculated using the binomial formula, and are the same as in the graph
        above. The binomial expected column has the probabilities multiplied by
        the total number of families, which is 1000.</p>
      <p>The Chi-square value is the (O-E)<sup>2</sup>/E calculated for each
        number of males, then summed.</p>
      <p>Degrees of freedom are number of levels, which is 5, minus 1.</p>
      <p>The p-value comes from comparing the calculated Chi-square value to a
        Chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. You can see the
        p-value is greater than 0.05, so we would conclude the observed
        frequencies match the binomial expected frequencies.</p>
      <h3 style=" clear: both">Conclusions to draw from a non-significant
        Chi-square GOF with binomial expected values</h3>
      <p style="clear: both">Remember, when we get a non-significant Chi-square
        test, we conclude that the data has the properties of the model that
        produced the expected frequencies. The important properties of the
        binomial distribution are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a single parameter, p, that applies to every trial - if the
          proportion of boys is p = 0.5, then every child has a probability of
          0.5 of being a boy.</li>
        <li>The trials are independent - that is, if one child is a boy, it has
          no effect on whether any other child in the family is a boy, like coin
          tosses. If some fathers are more likely to produce male offspring and
          others are more likely to produce female offspring then the sexes of
          offspring wouldn't be independent, and the binomial wouldn't predict
          the distribution of numbers of boys well.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="clear: both">With a non-significant Chi-square test for these
        data, we would conclude that the probability of male children is 1/2,
        and that the sexes of children in families are independent of one
        another.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="lack_independence">Lack of independence among trials</h2>
      <p>We can use a mismatch between our observed data and expected
        frequencies from the binomial to indicate that events were not
        independent, and lack of independence of events can be of interest to us
        scientifically. For an example of this approach, consider the apple.</p>
      <p><img src="lab4_binom_normal_prelab2_html_28d5aaae.jpg" name="graphics19"
          width="337" hspace="13" height="186" align="left" border="0">Apples
        are the reproductive system of an apple tree, and apple seeds only
        develop when they are fertilized by pollen. </p>
      <p>Apple pollen has to be carried from flower to flower by animals. For
        this example, we will stipulate that there are only two different types
        of potential pollinators for apples, bees and hummingbirds. Both animals
        pick up pollen while they feed on nectar from one flower and deliver it
        to the carpels of the next flower on which they feed. Bees are smaller
        than hummingbirds, and when bees visit an apple flower we might expect
        that it's possible for them to pollinate just a single carpel without
        pollinating any other. If this is true, the probability that any single
        carpel is pollinated should be unaffected by any other, each one like a
        flip of a coin. </p>
      <p>The binomial distribution is based on the assumption that each event is
        independent, and thus bee pollination might be modeled well by the
        binomial. In contrast, because hummingbirds are much larger than bees,
        we would expect they will frequently touch all of the carpels at once
        when they visit a flower, or alternatively they may skip flowers
        entirely. Hummingbirds, then, may exhibit "all or nothing" patterns of
        pollination, in which pollination is not independent among the carpels
        (more like tossing five coins all taped together, with heads on the same
        side). This lack of independence would make hummingbird pollination a
        poor match to the binomial distribution. If this is true, then the
        distribution of apples with each possible number of pollinated seeds
        could look something like this:</p>

      <p>Now that we have probabilities that a single seed will be pollinated,

        out of the five found in an apple. For bees, the probability that an
        apple would have all five seeds pollinated would be:</p>

            freedom is 2.69 x 10<sup>-156</sup>. We reject the null, and find
            that the hummingbird data do not fit the binomial distribution well.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br style="clear:both">
      <p>What can we conclude from this exercise? </p>
      <p>The bee data fits the binomial well, so we can conclude that bee
        pollination has the properties assumed by the binomial distribution.
        Specifically, the binomial distribution is based on the assumption that
        events are independent of one another, so our good fit to the binomial
        gives us support for the hypothesis that bees pollinate carpels
        independently of one another. </p>
      <p>For the hummingbirds, the binomial is clearly a lousy model for the
        distribution of number of seeds pollinated in apples. The poor fit of
        the hummingbird data to the binomial distribution, along with the large
        number of 5 seeds and 0 seeds pollinated, supports our hypothesis that
        hummingbirds tend to either pollinate all of the carpels or none of them
        when they visit apple flowers.</p>
      <p>So, the take-home points about the binomial are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you use expected values that accurately represent what
          your data would look like if they were randomly distributed among the
          categories - equal numbers or simple proportionality are not always to
          be expected.</li>
        <li>Fit or lack of fit to a model, like the binomial distribution, gives
          you some additional insight into the processes that generated the
          data. Good fit to a model is evidence that the data have the same
          properties as the model, and a poor fit to the model is evidence that
          the data do not share one or more of the model's properties.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="part" id="next_activity">Next activity</h2>
      <p>In the next activity we will practice using Chi-square goodness of fit
        testing using data on numbers of boys in families by birth order, and by
        doing the analysis of apple pollination using MINITAB.</p>
