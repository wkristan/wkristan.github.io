      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p> Today we will be using data from the Veterans Administration (VA)
        about survival times in patients suffering from one of two different
        types of lung cancer, small cell or large cell. Survival times are in
        weeks, following positive diagnosis of the disease and beginning of
        treatment. Survival times are often skewed, because most patients having
        relatively short survival times, but some survive for long periods. Each
        patient was also diagnosed as having one of two different kinds of
        cancer cells, small cell or large cell, which might affect survival
        times. The data are <a href="lung_cancer_survival.MTW">here</a>, in a
        file called "lung_cancer_survival.mtw".</p>
      <p>The first step will be to use normal probability plots and AD tests to
        check whether your data are normally distributed. Survival data is often
        skewed, and when you detect skew in these data, you will log-transform
        them and then re-check to see if you have improved their fit to the
        normal distribution. Skewed data will often also violate the HOV
        assumption, and transformation will frequently make the variances equal
        in addition to making the distributions normal, but you will need to
        check HOV after transformation to be sure. Then, you will then test the
        log-transformed data for effects of cell type on survival, using
        two-sample t-tests.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="cancer_survival">Cancer survival data</h2>
      <p>1. Open the file, and test whether the variable "time" is normally
        distributed, using probability plots and AD tests.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You need to test cell type groups separately, because differences
        between groups could affect the normality of the data, even though
        within groups the data are normally distributed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To avoid this, use the "Single" probability plot type (rather than
        "Multiple"), but use cell type as a "By variable" for each plot. To
        access the "By variable" option, click on the "Multiple graphs" button,
        and switch to the "By variable" tab. You may also place each plot in
        separate panels of the same graph to keep everything you need together
        in the same graph - check the "In separate panels of the same graph"
        option on the "Multiple Variables" tab.</p>
      <p>2. Construct a boxplot and histogram for the data, using "cell type" as
        "By variables". You should be able to tell from the histograms and box
        plots the cause of the non-normality.</p>
      <p>3. Test for HOV for time, grouped by cell type. You learned to do this
        as part of the two-sample t-test activity.</p>
      <p>Based on your results, you fail the normality test badly for one group
        (small cell), and fail the HOV test. We can't go forward with a t-test
        with both assumptions violated, so we need to try a transformation.</p>
      <p>4. To transform the data do the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Calc" → "<a href="transform1.png">Calculator</a>" </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter "log.time" as the "Store result in variable" box.</li>
          <li>Find "Natural log (log base e)" in the function list, and
            double-click it to enter it into the "Expression" box - this will
            give you a template to fill in that reads "LN(number)".</li>
          <li>Double-click "time" from the list of variables on the left - this
            will substitute the variable name "time" for "number" in the
            "LN(number)" function. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>When you then click "OK", natural log of all of the survival times
          will be calculated, and placed in column C4, with the title
          "log.time". When it's set up right, the calculator window will look
          like <a href="transform2.png">this</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have your log.time numbers, assess normality and HOV for
        log.time. You will see that you still fail the normality test for one
        group (large cell), but you pass HOV now. Since we are only violating
        one assumption with the log-transformed data, and only slightly in one
        group, it's okay to do a t-test now. </p>
      <p>5. Use a two-sample t-test to test for differences between cell types
        using the log-transformed "log.time" variable.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="back_trans">Back-transformation of the t-test results</h2>
      <p>Once you know that you reject the null, you need to interpret the
        results. It is a good idea to interpret the statistics that are actually
        analyzed, rather than switching to arithmetic means for interpretation.
        To get the statistics that are actually used back into the units that
        the data were recorded in we need to back-transform them.</p>
      <p>6. You can back-transform values from log weeks to weeks by using the
        "exp" function, which raises the base e to the power of x (where x is
        the value you want to back-transform). Below are the methods for
        calculating the exp function using MINITAB, Excel, or a scientific
        calculator.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In MINITAB, you can back transform using the calculator. Select "Calc"
        → "Calculator", and enter "Output" in the "Store result in variable"
        box. In the "Expression" box type exp(4.766) and hit "OK" (this is the
        large cell mean survival time on a log scale). You will now have a
        column named "Output" in your worksheet, and a value of 117.45 in the
        first row, which is the geometric mean survival time in weeks for the
        large cell group.</p>
      <p> Calculators differ in how they refer to the exp function, but the two
        common ways are EXP or e<sup>x</sup>. Type 4.766 into your calculator,
        then hit whichever of these two buttons you have - you should see 117.45
        as the answer. Since exp is the inverse of the natural log, you may find
        the exp function as the second function for the natural log key (often
        called "ln" on scientific calculators).</p>
      <p>Repeat this back-transformation for the small cell mean, and for the
        difference you recorded from the t-test results.</p>
      <h2>Confidence intervals with log-transformed data</h2>
      <p>Confidence intervals are important for assessing how good the estimates
        we are basing our conclusions on are. Since we are using geometric
        means, we want the confidence intervals we report to be for the
        geometric means as well. To do this, we need to calculate the confidence
        intervals on a log scale, and then back-transform the upper and lower
        limits.</p>
      <p>7. Calculate a confidence interval for log.time for large and small
        cell cancers. You can use MINITAB's interval plots for this (as you
        learned in the confidence interval activity), or you can use the
        "graphical summary" to obtain the confidence interval. To use the
        graphical summary, select "Stat" → "Basic statistics" → "Graphical
        summary". In the form that pops up, use "log.time" as the variable, and
        "celltype" as the "By variable" and click "OK". The graphs that pop up
        have all sorts of useful information, including a 95% confidence
        interval for the mean.</p>
      <p>8. Once you have the upper and lower limits recorded on your worksheet,
        use the exp() function to back-transform them. This will give you the
        95% confidence intervals for the geometric means for each group, in
        units of weeks of survival.</p>
      <p>That's it! Answer the questions on your worksheet to complete the
        assignment.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> A biologist is studying how hunger influences movement distances in
        snails. She collects 70 snails from the grounds of her university, and
        randomly divides them into two groups. The first group of 35 is given
        water but is kept without food for five days. The other group of 35 is
        treated the same way, but is given leaves to eat for five days. At the
        end of the five day period, she places each snail, one at a time, in the
        center of a circular arena, and measures the distance traveled in a
        5-minute period. The data for this experiment is in <a href="challenge_q_lab8a.MTW">this
          file</a>, which represent distances moved in centimeters.</p>
      <p> A. Test whether these data are normally distributed. Apply an
        appropriate transformation, then re-test for normality. Report results
        in the table below.</p>
