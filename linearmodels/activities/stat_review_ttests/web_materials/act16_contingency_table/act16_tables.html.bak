              <p>The Titanic became famous by being an unsinkable luxury liner
                that sank in the north Atlantic in 1912. Two thirds of the 2201
                passengers and crew died by drowning or hypothermia.</p>
              <p>The Titanic disaster has attracted its fair share of ugly
                rumors and conspiracy theories. Ultimately, there is only so
                much we can know about what happened that day, but passenger
                data is in the public record and we can use it to address some
                questions. </p>
            </td>
          </tr>

      <p>For example, we might want to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Were women and children spared?</li>
        <li>Did the crew go down with the ship? </li>
        <li>Were first class passengers at an advantage over third class
          passengers?</li>
        <li>Were differences in survival between men and women the same in all
          classes?</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="part" id="data">The data</h2>
      <p>For each person on the ship, we have data on class, sex, age, and fate.
        The data are <a href="titanic.MTW">here.</a> Each variable is
        categorical, and we will be using contingency table analysis to assess
        the associations between fate (survived or died) and either class
        (first, second, third, or crew), sex (male or female), or age (adult or
        child). The data sheet also has a column called MWC that combines the
        information about sex and age into categories for children (regardless
        of sex), and adult men and women.</p>
      <p>For the lab assignment, you will plot the data using bar charts, and
        then test for significant associations between variables using
        contingency tables. If you find significant associations between
        variables, any further interpretation of the results should be based on
        values of standardized residuals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="graphs"> Graphs:</h2>
      <p> 1. Start with a bar chart of the number of men and women who survived
        and didn't survive. Select "<a href="bar_charts.jpg">Graph → Bar chart</a>",
        and then the "<a href="chart_sex.jpg">Stack</a>" type. Include the
        variables "<a href="chart_sex1.jpg">Sex" and "Survived"</a>.</p>
      <p> Now, click on "Chart Options...", and check "Show Y as Percent", and "<a
          href="chart_options.png">Within categories at level 1 (outermost)</a>".
        This will give us a graph that makes a comparison of the percent of
        women and men that survived maximally easy. Bear in mind that this does
        not display the differences in the number of men and women that survived
        or died, but we'll use the tables we create when we do the analysis to
        see how the numbers compared.</p>
      <p> We could make a similar chart for adults vs. children, but there are
        so few children that it's difficult to see any patterns on a graph.
        We'll look at whether children were spared later, when we quantitatively
        analyze the data.</p>
      <p> 2. Now look at whether class seems to have had an effect on survival.
        Plot a bar chart with "Survived" and "Class" as the grouping variables.</p>
      <p> 3. Finally, look at whether our impression of the effects of sex seem
        to depend on class. To do this, repeat step 1, but once you have
        selected the variables, click on the "Multiple graphs..." button and put
        "Class" into the box for "<a href="chart_multiples.jpg">By variables
          with groups in separate panels</a>".</p>
      <p> For comparison, make the same chart again, but this time in the Chart
        Options, un-check "Show Y as Percent". This will help you see how the <em><strong>numbers</strong></em>
        of mean and women who survived or died differed between the classes.</p>
      <p> Now it's time to answer the questions posed in the introduction.</p>
      <h2><span class="part" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" id="women_children">
          Were women and children spared?</span></h2>
      <p> 1. Select "Stat → Tables → <a href="tables.jpg">Cross-tabulation and
          Chi-square</a>". Use "MWC" (for Men, Women, and Children) as the "Row"
        variable and "Survived" as the "Column" variable (it should look like <a
          href="tables_mwc.jpg">this</a>). The MWC column combines information
        both about sex and age, and will give us an idea of whether men
        disproportionately perished compared with women and children. Click on
        the "Chi-square" button, and ask for "Chi-square analysis", "Expected
        cell counts", and "Standardized residuals" (like <a href="tables_options2.jpg">this</a>).
        </p>
      <p>If women and children were spared, you would expect positive
        standardized residuals for these groups for the "yes" survival group,
        with values of 2 or more - you should also expect negative standardized
        residuals with magnitudes (i.e. absolute values) greater than 2 for the
        "no" survival group; surviving more than expecting seems as though it
        has to be paired with dying less than expected, but that's not always
        the case, since it depends on the size of the expected value. </p>
      <p>Similarly, if men died more than expected, then you would expect
        negative standardized residuals with magnitudes greater than 2 for the
        "yes" survival group (i.e. they survived significantly less often than
        expected), and positive standardized residuals with magnitudes greater
        than 2 for the "no" survival group (i.e. they died significantly more
        often than expected).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2><span class="part" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" id="crew">
          Did the crew go down with the ship? Were first class passengers at an
          advantage?</span></h2>
      <p> 1. Repeat the analysis, but this time use "Class" as the row variable.
        If the crew went down with the ship, you would expect a positive
        standardized residual for the "no" survival group, with a magnitude of 2
        or more (and probably the converse - negative standardized residual with
        a magnitude over 2 for the "yes" group). If the first class passengers
        were favored over third class passengers, either the first class should
        have a significant positive residual for the "yes" survival group, the
        third class should have a significant positive residual for the "no"
        survival group, or both.</p>
      <h2><span class="part" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" id="sex_by_class">
          Was the effect of sex the same for all classes?</span></h2>
      <p> 1. Repeat the analysis of sex, but this time use "Class" as the
        "Layer". Also, click on "Row percents" to make it easier to compare
        results between the different classes. It should look like <a href="file:///home/bill/Documents/classes/biostat/activities/lab_assignments/web_materials/act14_contingency_table/tables_withlayers.jpg">this</a>.</p>
      <p>Note that using class as a layer splits the data set by class, and
        gives you a separate Chi-square contingency table analysis for each one.
        The classes are not being compared statistically in this case, but you
        can look at the results for each class and see whether they are
        consistent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge questions:</h2>
      <p>Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an important public health
        problem. Some bacteria carry genes which make them resistant to
        antibiotics, and antibiotics kill bacteria that do not carry these
        genes. Consequently, bacteria that do carry resistance genes are
        strongly favored, and over time resistant bacteria become more common.
        When this occurs, the antibiotics lose their therapeutic value.</p>
      <p>A scientist is interested in studying whether use of antibiotics in
        chicken farms promotes antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The scientist
        identifies 100 farms that use the antibiotic enrofloxacin to treat
        bacterial infections in their flocks, and 100 that do not use any
        antibiotics. He takes fecal samples from each farm, and cultures
        bacteria from each fecal sample on an agar plate in the lab (which gives
        him a categorical variable with two levels, "antibiotics" and "no
        antibiotics"). All of the plates grow bacterial cultures, and after five
        days, he treats each plate with enrofloxacin; colonies that lack
        resistance genes are killed by the antibiotic, such that live colonies
        indicate resistance, and dead colonies indicate no resistance. The
        following day, he counts how many colonies are alive or dead from each
        group, giving him a categorical variable with two levels ("alive" and
        "dead"). The data are in <a href="challenge_q_lab12.MTW">this file</a>,
        with the farm type (antibiotic, or no antibiotic) in the first column,
        and bacterial survival (alive, dead) after antibiotic treatment in the
        second.</p>
      <p>A. What statistical procedure should you use to test whether bacterial
        survival is dependent on farm type?</p>
      <p>B. Conduct the test, and provide the test statistic, degrees of
        freedom, and p-value below.</p>
      <p>C. In the table below, give observed values, expected values, and
        standardized residuals. Circle the combinations of farm type and
        bacterial survival with standardized residuals that indicate a
        significant difference between observed and expected.</p>

      <p>D. Answer the researcher's question - do these data provide evidence
        that use of enrofloxacin leads to increased bacterial resistance?</p>
      <p>E. In this experiment, the researcher did not randomly assign farms to
        treatment groups (antibiotic or no antibiotic), but instead he selected
        farms that had decided for themselves whether to use antibiotics or not.
        How might this self-assignment of treatment type have given you the
        results you observed, even if antibiotic use on these farms was not
        causing an increase in antibiotic resistance? Even though these data are
        not continuous variables, explain how this is an example of the point
        that "correlation does not prove causation". How might you design an
        experiment that would better establish a cause/effect relationship
        between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance?</p>
