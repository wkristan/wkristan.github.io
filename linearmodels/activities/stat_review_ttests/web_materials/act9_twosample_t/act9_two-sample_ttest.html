      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p> As of the end of today, you will have learned three different types of
        t-test: the one-sample t, the paired t, and the independent samples
        t-test (a.k.a. 2-sample t-test). You will have a chance to work with the
        independent samples and paired t today, but as you are working through
        the examples, keep in mind that in your work (or on an exam) you will
        need to pick which test to use, given what you know about the data. The
        way to do this is to match the test to the experimental design: if only
        a single sample is being drawn that is being compared to a hypothetical
        population mean, it is a one-sample design, and should be tested with a
        one-sample t-test. If there are two groups being compared, and there is
        a natural pairing between data values in the first group and data values
        in the second group, it is a paired design that should be tested with a
        paired t-test. If you are comparing two independently measured sets of
        data, it is an independent samples design, and should be compared with a
        2-sample t-test.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="darwin">Example 1 - Differences in height/stride
        ratio between sexes.</h2>
      <p>In our last exercise, we compared height/stride ratios of a sample of
        men and a sample of women to hypothetical values of 1.20 for men, and
        1.21 for women. From this we learned that the observed height to stride
        ratios were significantly different from the hypothetical values for
        women, but not for men. We didn't test whether the sexes differed from
        one another last time, only whether the sexes differed from their
        hypothetical population means. Today we will compare the two sexes to
        one another.</p>
      <p>A comparison of two samples means is a two-sample hypothesis - we're
        using differences between two sample means to test a hypothesis about a
        lack of difference in the means of the populations the samples were
        drawn from.</p>
      <p>1. Use <a href="ht_stride_stacked2.MTW">this version of the data</a> -
        this is the same data we used last time, but it is "stacked", with the
        measured height to stride ratios in one column, and the sex of the
        person indicated in a second column.</p>
      <p>2. Test for homogeneity of variances (HOV), by selecting "Stat" →
        "Basic Statistics" → "<a href="twosample_HOV_menu.jpg">2 Variances</a>".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the form that pops up, put "Sex" in the "Sample IDs" box, and
          "HtToStride" in the "<a href="twosample_HOV2.jpg">Samples</a>" box. </li>
        <li>Click on "Options", and in the "Two Sample Variance: Options" window
          check the "Use test and confidence intervals based on normal
          distribution" (this will give us an F-test for our comparison of
          variances. If you DON'T get an F test, you didn't check this box!). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the Session window, you will get output from the F test. The "Test
        statistic" is the F-value, which is the ratio of the variances - you'll
        see that ratio is 0.24, meaning that the women's variance is 0.24 times
        the men's variance.</p>
      <p>Note that the p-value reporting is a little weird in MINITAB - the
        p-value is shown as 0.000, but we know that a probability of 0 means
        that it's impossible to get a ratio of variances equal to 0.24 when the
        null hypothesis of equal variances is true, and that can't be the case.
        What MINITAB is actually doing is reporting a probability that is really
        tiny (p = 4.8x10<sup>-12</sup>) to only the third decimal place, and
        discarding all the other digits. When you see a probability of 0.000
        reported in MINITAB, interpret it as telling you that the probability is
        less than 0.001, which is the smallest number that can be displayed with
        three decimal places - report p-values like this as &lt; 0.001 instead
        of 0.</p>
      <p>With a tiny p-value like this that is much less than 0.05 we reject the
        null hypothesis of equal variances - when we do the t-test in step 4 we
        will have to not assume HOV.</p>
      <p>3. Test for normality. Group by sex, and report the results on your
        worksheet. We did this last week on these data, but we want to get in
        the habit of doing this test every time.</p>
      <p>4. Test for differences between men and women. Select "Stat" → "Basic
        Statistics" → "Two-sample t-test". The default option is for the data to
        be "stacked", which means that each row is a different person, one
        column indicates the group, and the other is the numeric data - the
        drop-down menu option states this as "Both samples are in one column".
        The "Samples" are the measured data (HtToStride), and "Sample IDs" are
        the group indicator (Sex). Since we did not meet the HOV assumption in
        step 2, click on "Options...", and make sure the "Assume equal
        variances" check box is not checked. If you don't check the box Welch's
        t-test is used, which compensates for the lack of equal variances by
        reduce the degrees of freedom.</p>
      <p>Click "OK" for the options, and then "OK" for the two-sample t window
        to run the test.</p>
      <p>Refer to the assignment sheet for results to report. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="bicep_arm">Example 2 - Bicep circumference and arm
        length</h2>
      <p> Although we are used to thinking of ourselves as being symmetrical on
        our left and right sides, most of us are either right-handed or
        left-handed. We will refer to the side each person prefers as their
        "dominant" arm, and the other, non-preferred side the "subordinate" arm.
      </p>
      <p><img alt="Rafael Nadal" src="nadal.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px"><img
          alt="Rod Laver" src="rod_laver.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left: 10px">Handedness
        can produce differences between the right and left sides of our body.
        The effect of preferential use of one side should be most obvious for
        muscle mass, since it responds directly to exercise. Tennis players are
        good examples of this effect - their racket arm is often much more
        muscular than their other arm, as you can see in these pictures of
        Rafael Nadal (left) and Rod Laver (right). </p>
      <p>For most people if there is any difference in muscle sizes between
        their dominant and subordinate arms it is likely to be much less
        dramatic than what we see in tennis players. Additionally, the amount of
        difference between dominant and subordinate arms would probably be small
        compared to the large amount of variation in sizes of arms between
        people.</p>
      <p>Given this, if we used a sample of people and measured their dominant
        arms, and a separate independent sample of people to measure their
        subordinate arms, the amount of difference between the two groups might
        be obscured by the individual variation among people. If instead we used
        one sample of people and measured the dominant and subordinate bicep
        circumferences on each one, we might find a small but consistent amount
        of difference at the level of individuals. Focusing on the differences
        eliminates the variation from person to person, and consistent small
        differences can be detected reliably once this <strong>nuisance</strong>
        variation between people is removed statistically.</p>
      <p>We wouldn't necessarily expect the sizes of the bones in the arms to be
        as responsive to exercise as muscle mass is, so we will also look at arm
        lengths. People's arms may not be exactly the same length, but we
        wouldn't necessarily expect the dominant arm to be longer than the
        subordinate arm. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span class="part" style="font-weight: bold;">Paired
          t-test for two group data - using MINITAB's paired t-test function:</span></h3>
      <p>Download and open <a href="arm_bicep.mtw">this</a> file. Once you have
        the file open, notice that the organization of the data is different
        here. The first data set was a "stacked" arrangement, in which we had
        one column indicating the treatment group, and another with the measured
        data. When we do a paired t-test, MINITAB requires the data to be
        unstacked, with the data from one type of measurement (dominant arm)
        next to the data for the other type (subordinate arm).</p>
      <p>The first column indicates the sex of the person - we won't be using
        this column directly, because the differences between the sexes will get
        eliminated when we subtract the dominant and subordinate measurements
        for each person; in other words, as long as both women and men
        consistently increase in bicep size in their dominant arm the sizes of
        their arms won't matter anymore once we have calculated the differences.</p>
      <p>Columns "DomBicep" and "SubBicep" have measurements of the dominant and
        subordinate biceps for each person, and columns "DomArmLength" and
        "SubArmLength" have the lengths of their two arms. Since we are
        measuring both arms on each person there is a natural pairing between
        the values for the same variable in the same row - this is a paired
        design. When we use a paired design we need to use a paired t-test to
        account for the lack of independence of the two measurements.</p>
      <p>1. First we need to check for normality of differences for bicep. Since
        these are pairs of measurements for each person in class, the rows
        represent a single person's measurements. A paired t-test is a
        one-sample test of the differences between the pairs of measurements
        against 0, and the paired t-test assumes these differences are normally
        distributed. When MINITAB does a paired t-test it calculates the
        differences for you internally, but the differences aren't put into the
        worksheet. To test for normality of the differences we need to enter
        them into the worksheet first, which we can do as a calculation.</p>
      <p>Select "Calc" → "Calculator". In "Store result in variable" type in
        "Bicep diffs". Build the expression "DomBicep" - "SubBicep", and click
        "OK".</p>
      <p>Now you should see a column of differences called "Bicep diffs" that
        you can test for normality. Do a normal probability plot, and check the
        AD and p-values to determine if the data pass the normality test.</p>
      <p>2. Select "Stat" → "Basic Statistics" → "<a href="paired_t3.png">Paired
          t</a>". In the form that pops up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put "DomBicep" in the "Sample 1" box</li>
        <li>Put "SubBicep" in the "<a href="paired_t4.png">Sample 2</a>" box.</li>
        <li>Click on the "Graphs..." button, and select the "Histogram of
          differences" option.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Run the test.</p>
      <p>4. Record the t-test results on your assignment sheet. You'll find the
        mean of the differences, t-value, and p-value for the test in the
        Session window. The graph shows the distribution of differences - two of
        the differences are negative, meaning that the subordinate bicep was
        bigger than the dominant bicep for two people, but most differences were
        positive, and on average the difference was 0.2607 inches. The
        differences were sufficiently consistent that this roughly 1/4 inch
        difference is statistically significant.</p>
      <p>5. Repeat for arm length. You will see that arm lengths are not
        different between dominant and subordinate sides. The mean difference is
        much smaller, 0.0213, which you can see from the histogram is due to the
        fact that positive and negative differences happen about equally
        frequently.</p>
      <p>Answer the questions on your worksheet based on your analysis. You do
        not need to print graphs for this assignment.<br>

      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> Insects and crustaceans lack our complex immune system, but they do
        produce simple antiviral proteins that protect them from infections. A
        biotech company has synthesized one of these compounds, and is
        interested in testing its effectiveness in curing the common cold. They
        experimentally infect 18 mice with rhinovirus (the virus that causes
        colds) and randomly select half to receive the antiviral medication. The
        other half are used as untreated controls. Blood tests are conducted
        each day, and the presence of viral DNA is assessed. The file <a href="challenge_q_lab7.mtw">here</a>
        has data on the number of days each of these 18 mice carried the virus.</p>
      <p>Part I.</p>
      <p>A. Test for normality, and report the AD and p values.</p>
      <p>B. Test for HOV, and report the F and p values.</p>
      <p>C. What is the null and alternate hypothesis for this test?</p>
      <p>D. Test for effects of the antiviral on duration of infection. Give the
        observed t-value, the p-value, and give your conclusion (did you reject
        Ho:?).</p>
      <p>E. Interpret your results - was this compound effective at changing the
        duration of the common cold?</p>
      <p>Part II.</p>
      <p>Instead of using two different groups of mice above, the experiment
        could have used the same mice for both treatments. For example, they
        could have infected a group of mice and observed how long they took to
        recover without the antiviral protein, and then infected the same mice
        again and observed how long they took to recover when they were given
        the antiviral protein.</p>
      <p>A. How would this change in design change the statistical test used?
        What would be the proper test?</p>
      <p>B. Would it be necessary to test HOV? Why or why not?</p>
      <p> C. Would this experimental design be as good as the previous one? Why
        might this design lead to misleading results?</p>
