              <p>The proportionate relationships between different body parts
                were illustrated by Leonardo Da Vinci in his ca. 1490 drawing,
                the Vitruvian Man. There are good biological reasons to expect
                proportionality between body parts. Body parts do not grow at a
                constant rate, and babies are born with very different
                proportions than adults (babies have bigger heads and shorter
                limbs). But, as we grow all of our body parts grow, such that we
                end up with fairly consistent proportions among our arms, legs,
                torsos, etc. A variable like height is actually made up of
                lengths of leg bones, lengths of vertebrae, lengths of skulls,
                and a variety of other contributors, all of which tend to grow
                more or less proportionately during development. Because our
                body parts are all subject to a common growth pattern, you will
                often find that the ratio of body parts is very consistent, even
                for people of very different size.</p>

              <p>A good example of a fairly consistent known relationship is the
                ratio of height to stride length, which is reportedly <strong>1.20
                  for men</strong> and <strong>1.21 for women</strong>. Stride
                length is the distance from a clearly identifiable landmark in
                one footprint (such as the middle of the heel in the
                illustration on the left, or on the back of the heel as we will
                use today) to that landmark on the next footprint for the same
                foot - in other words, it's equivalent to two steps. This ratio
                is used by scientists such as anthropologists and criminologists
                to estimate heights of people from footprints, either in fossils
                or at crime scenes, respectively. It's generally easier to
                measure stride length accurately than step length, because that
                measurement requires one to interpolate the perpendicular line
                from one foot to the middle of the track for the other
                foot.&nbsp; In contrast, stride length can be measured on a
                straight line from heel to heel of the same foot, and should be
                a more consistent length. </p>

      <p> If we know the ratio of height to stride length we apply it to a
        measured stride length from a set of footprints to estimate a person's
        height (that is, stride x (height/stride) = height). This only works if
        we the height/stride ratio is accurate (i.e. correct on average).</p>
      <p>Today we will collect data on stride lengths and test whether these
        reported values of 1.20 for men and 1.21 for women are consistent with
        the stride lengths from our class. If our average stride lengths are not
        significantly different from the standard ratios, we will conclude that
        the ratios are accurate. If in addition the variability of individual
        stride lengths is small, we will conclude that the ratio is consistent
        enough to be useful for predicting heights. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="analysis">Data analysis</h2>
      <p>We will be using an existing data set of height to stride ratios for
        100 women and 100 mean. Download and open <a href="ht_stride.mtw">this
          file</a>, and you will see one column of height/stride ratios for
        females, and one for males.</p>
      <p>1. <strong>Check normality</strong>. Check the variable for normality
        using a normal probability plot, and accompanying AD test. This is the
        same analysis you learned in the last activity (do a probability plot,
        and the AD test is reported in the upper-right corner).</p>
      <p>The Anderson Darling (AD) normality test is, in fact, a statistical
        hypothesis test (if p &lt; 0.05 we "fail" and our data aren't normal,
        and if p &gt; 0.05 we "pass" and our data are normal). However, the null
        hypothesis for the AD test is that our data match the normal
        distribution, and this test doesn't tell us anything about whether
        height/stride length ratios are equal to 1.2 or 1.21 - the only purpose
        of the normality test is to make sure we can get accurate results when
        we move on to the one-sample t-test of μ = 1.2 (men) or μ = 1.21
        (women).</p>
      <p>If you fail the test note this, but go ahead and move on to the t-test.
        We don't really have a choice at this stage but to use the one-sample
        t-test even if we fail the normality test, but usually this would cause
        us to stop what we're doing and pick another analysis. We'll discuss the
        consequences of failing the normality test (and what one might do about
        it) later this semester.<br>
      </p>
      <p>2. <strong>Conduct the t-test</strong>. Select "Stat → Basic
        Statistics → <a href="one-sample_t.png">One-sample t...</a>".</p>
      <p>We'll start with the males - select the measured variable (Male) for
        "Samples in Columns" and fill in 1.20 for <a href="onesample_t_minitab.jpg">"Hypothesized
          mean"</a> in the "Perform hypothesis test" section. The "Hypothesized
        mean" entry is the hypothetical value against which you're testing our
        class data.</p>
      <p>Before you run the test, click on "Graphs" and ask for a "Histogram of
        data."</p>
      <p>Then, run the analysis. You will get some numerical output in the
        Session window, including the name of the variable you're testing, the
        sample size, the mean, standard deviation and standard error of the
        mean, a 95% confidence interval for the mean, an observed T value, and a
        p-value. Report the T-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value on your
        worksheet.</p>
      <p>The histogram of the data adds symbols to the usual histogram
        indicating the location of the null hypothetical mean (mu, which is 1.20
        for the first test), the sample mean, and a confidence interval around
        the hypothetical mean. If the mean of the data falls within the
        confidence interval for mu, you can't conclude your sample mean is
        different from mu - you retain the null hypothesis. If the sample mean
        is outside of the confidence interval, you'd reject the null, and
        conclude that your sample mean is significantly different from mu. This
        should help you visualize what the hypothesis test is doing.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Repeat the analysis for women</strong>. Repeat the
        procedure for the women's data, and don't forget to use the women's
        height/stride ratio (1.21) as the value for mu.</p>
      <h2 class="part">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> Fire ants were accidentally introduced to the Gulf Coast of the US,
        and have been spreading throughout areas of warmer climates. They have
        been detected in San Diego County, and the county monitors for them to
        see if they are establishing themselves. Twenty survey locations are set
        up around the county, and the proportion of total ant mounds observed
        that belong to fire ants is recorded at each site. Based on experience
        in other areas, the ants are expected to be permanently established once
        they make up at least 25% of ant mounds in an area, but if they are less
        than 25% they may still fail to establish permanently. The data <a href="challenge_q_lab6.mtw">here</a>
        gives the percentage of ant mounds that were fire ants at 20 sites.</p>
      <p>A. Test for normality, and report the AD and&nbsp;p values. Are these
        data normally distributed?<u> </u></p>
      <p>B. What procedure will you use to test whether have established in the
        county?</p>
      <p>C. What is the null hypothesis for this test? What is the alternate
        hypothesis?</p>
      <p>D. Conduct the test and report t-observed, d.f., and p-value. Did you
        reject Ho:?</p>
      <p>E. What statistical results would lead you to the conclusion that fire
        ants have established in San Diego County? What do you conclude from
        your results?</p>
      <p>F. The introduction to this problem states that it's known that fire
        ants are in SD county, but suppose that it was not yet known whether the
        ants occurred here. Could you modify your statistical test to test the
        hypothesis that there were no fire ants in SD county? How would you do
        it? Would it make sense to do so? Why or why not?</p>
