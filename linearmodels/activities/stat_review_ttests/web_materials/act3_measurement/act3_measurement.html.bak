        of simple measurements</h2>
      <p> <img src="earthworm.jpg" name="graphics1" alt="Worm" style="width: 132; height: 157; float: left;">
        Today we will be comparing your accuracy and precision in measuring two
        different objects (artificial worms and snail shells) using two
        different instruments (calipers and rulers). To do this, you will need
        to make repeated measurements of the same object so that you can assess
        how consistently you are able to make your measurements.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that we want to use this set of measurements to assess how
        accurately and precisely you can use these instruments to measure these
        objects in general, so you do not need to exercise excessive levels of
        care (you aren't scored on how well you measure here, so just measure
        the way you normally would).<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="instructions">Making the measurements</h2>
      <p>For each set of measurements, there is a place on your assignment sheet
        to record your observations. Record all of your measurements to the
        resolution of the instrument, in mm.</p>
      <p>1. Select a single artificial worm and measure its length five times
        using calipers, and record the measurements in block B (Worm) in the
        column labeled "Caliper".</p>
      <p>Then, measure the same worm five times using a ruler, and enter the
        data in block B in the column labeled "Ruler".</p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="shell_dimension.png" alt="Shell dimension to measure"><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>2. Select a single snail shell and measure its diameter five
                times using calipers, and five times using a ruler. The
                illustration the the left shows the dimension you need to
                measure. Since snail shells are irregular and round, we may face
                different challenges measuring them than with the worms. Enter
                the data in block A (Snail shell) in the appropriate columns.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>3. To assess whether there are inter-observer variability problems I
        will circulate a single worm for you to measure. Just as with your own
        worm, you will measure the class worm five times with the calipers, and
        five times with the ruler, and record your measurements into table C of
        your worksheet.</p>
      <p><strong>WHEN YOU GET THE CLASS WORM, stop what you're doing and measure
          it right away, five times repeatedly. As soon as you are done with
          your measurements, enter your class worm data from table C on your
          worksheet into the class database before returning to your own
          measurements.</strong></p>
      <p>4. Start MINITAB, and enter your own data into it (the data in tables A
        and B on your assignment sheet). Begin with the worm data - we will use
        a "stacked" arrangement. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first column will indicate the observation number. Number the
          observations 1 through 5 for each instrument. </li>
        <li>The second column indicates the instrument used to make the
          measurement (either ruler or caliper). </li>
        <li>The third column indicates the worm length measured, like <a href="stacked_data_worm.jpg">this</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To enter the shell data, just add an additional column called "Shell",
        and enter the measurements for your shell. The layout of the final
        worksheet should look like <a href="stacked_data_with_shell.jpg">this</a>
        (the numbers will be different since you measured different objects, but
        the organization should be the same).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="precision of single measurements">Precision of single
        measurements</h3>
      <p>The <strong>resolution</strong> of the instruments tells us the
        smallest unit the instrument is capable of measuring (which is 1 mm for
        the ruler and 0.01 mm for the calipers). The resolution of the
        instruments suggest a couple of things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we measure the same object repeatedly, and record the
          measurements with the significant digits that match the resolution of
          the instrument we use, we should not see any differences in the
          measurements. With a ruler the measurements should all be the same to
          the nearest 1 mm, and with a caliper the measurements should be the
          same to the nearest 0.01 mm. If this is not true, then differences in
          measurements made of the same object with the same instrument are due
          to measurement error.</li>
        <li>We would expect that measurements made with a caliper are 100 times
          more precise than measurements made with a ruler. If this is not true,
          it would mean that error is being introduced into the measurements by
          difficulties we experience in using the calipers consistently to make
          the measurements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>To make the comparison between ruler and caliper, we need a
                measure of variability in our measurements. Since differences in
                repeated measurements are due to measurement error, we can
                expect that the measurements have a bell-shaped distribution,
                like the graph to the right (in general, measurement errors are
                usually bell-shaped).</p>
              <p>We know that in a bell-shaped distribution 95% of the data
                should fall within ±2 standard deviations from the mean. In the
                graph to the right the mean worm length measurement is 85 mm,
                and the standard deviation of the measurements is 0.1. The lower
                end of the red shaded region is thus 85 - 2(0.1) = 84.8, and the
                upper end is 85 + 2(0.1) = 85.2. We can thus use 2 times the
                standard deviation as a measurement of how far away from the
                mean we can expect 95% of the measurements we make to be.</p>
            </td>
            <td><img alt="Precision" src="measurement_precision.png"><br>
              <br>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>5. So, to complete Question 1 on your worksheet, calculate the standard
        deviation of your measurements of each object, grouped by instrument.
        Then, multiply the standard deviations by 2, and record them in the
        table on your worksheet for Question 1. Record the resolution of the
        caliper (0.01 mm) and the ruler (1 mm) in the parentheses in the column
        headings. You can then answer Question 2.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3 class="part" id="ind val plot">Individual value plots</h3>
      <p>6. To visualize your measurement accuracy and precision, you will now
        construct two "individual value plots", one for worms and another for
        shells (blocks A and B, but not the class data in C). The instrument
        used (calipers or ruler) will be on the x-axis, and the measurement will
        be on the y-axis. You can see from this graph how variable your
        measurements are (precision), and whether they differ on average
        (accuracy - except, of course, you won't know if one is right and the
        other wrong, or if both are wrong. But, if they don't have the same mean
        they definitely can't both be accurate, right?).<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You will print these out and attach them to your assignment sheet (you
        can copy and paste multiple graphs into Microsoft Word, and then print
        them on one or two pieces of paper to save printing costs).</p>
      <p>Individual value plots show each data point along the y-axis, and can
        separate different groups along the x-axis. This plot will allow us to
        see how the measurements with each instrument compared.</p>
      <p> A. Select "<a href="ind_value_plot.png">Graph → Individual value plot</a>"</p>
      <p> B. In the form that opens, select the options for "One Y" and "<a href="ind_value_plot1.png">With
          Groups</a>".</p>
      <p> C. The next form allows you to select which data you will plot on the
        y-axis, and which "group" variable you will use for the x-axis. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Shell" and "Worm" as the "Graph variable". We will only be
          interested in comparing caliper and ruler measurements for worm, and
          caliper and ruler measurements for shell, but we can make both of the
          graphs we need at the same time.</li>
        <li>Select "Instrument" as the "<a href="ind_value_plot2.png">Categorical
            variables for grouping</a>". By default this will make two different
          graphs, one for shell diameter and another for worm length, which is
          what you want.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The resulting graph will look like <a href="ind_value_plot6.png">this</a>
        (again, the layout should be the same, but the data points will be
        different).</p>
      <p>Answer the questions on your assignment sheet that pertain to your own
        data (3, 4, and 5) based on these graphs.</p>
      <p>7. To answer the questions about the class worm data, you will need to
        wait for me to make the graph and post it on the class web site. We will
        talk about it as a class in our next class meeting, so you can wait to
        answer these final questions until then. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p>Daryl is studying fat reserves in ground squirrels, and would like to
        measure how fat storage changes monthly during a year. To do this, he
        needs a reliable, non-lethal method of measuring fat content so he can
        measure the same animal repeatedly over time. He is considering two
        possible methods, a DXA machine (which uses x-rays to measure body
        composition) and skin fold thickness (which estimates body fat based on
        thickness of a fold of skin, measured with a caliper). The DXA is more
        precise, but requires that animals be transported to the DXA facility at
        Daryl's campus and back, whereas skin fold thickness can be measured in
        the field. He is willing to use skin fold thickness if it can be used
        consistently by different observers.</p>
      <p>Daryl will have three assistants helping him on his study, Meryl,
        Teryl, and Carole. To test the alternative methods, he and each of his
        helpers measure fat on a single captured squirrel five times using the
        DXA, and using the calipers. He then sacrifices the animal and uses a
        highly accurate and precise method of fat extraction in the lab to
        measure body fat for this animal, which serves as the "true value" of
        percent fat that he's estimating. Based on fat extraction, body fat
        content for this animal was 20.345%.</p>
      <p>The data from this study are <a href="challenge_q_lab2.mtw">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <p> a. Is there any evidence that using calipers to measure skin fold
        thickness leads to inter-observer variation in fat estimates? How did
        you determine this? Which observers are most different from one another?</p>
      <p>b. Is there any evidence of inter-observer variation in fat estimates
        using the DXA? How did you determine this?</p>
      <p>c. Which method is more precise? How do you know?</p>
      <p>d. Based on the data presented, are either sets of measurements biased?
        How so you know? </p>
      <p>e. Based on the data presented about the precision and accuracy of DXA
        and caliper measurements of body fat, which should Daryl use? Why?</p>
      <h2>Experimental design question</h2>
      <p>Our bodies acclimate to the low oxygen concentrations at high elevation
        by increasing the amount of oxygen-carrying components of our cells. For
        example, our red blood cell (RBC) count goes up when we are exposed to
        low oxygen levels for prolonged periods. High RBC counts are beneficial
        to athletes, and there has been interest in taking advantage
        high-elevation acclimation to boost athletic performance. However,
        training in low-oxygen environments is harder, and has to be done at a
        lower intensity. Consequently, it is thought that an athlete that "lives
        high and trains low" can balance these effects - in other words, by
        training at low elevation where oxygen concentrations are high while
        living at high elevation where oxygen concentrations are low may give
        athletes the best of both worlds. </p>
      <p>To test this possibility, Janet called on CSUSM athletes to volunteer
        to give blood samples. All of the athletes trained at CSUSM, which is at
        590 feet (low elevation). She selected 20 who lived near the coast, at
        elevations no higher than San Marcos, for the control group, and
        selected 20 who live in Julian, Crestline, and other towns in the region
        at or above 4,000 feet (high elevation) for the "train low, live high"
        group. Blood was drawn, and RBC counts were obtained for all 40. Based
        on these data, Janet found that athletes in the "live high, train low"
        group had a significantly higher RBC count than the controls.</p>
      <p>1. How should the athletes have been assigned to training treatment
        groups? What problem could have occurred from the method used to assign
        athletes to treatment groups?</p>
      <p>2. Name at least two potentially confounding variables that were not
        controlled in this study.</p>
      <p>3. Were the athletes blinded? Were the researchers? Would it matter for
        a study like this (why or why not)?</p>
      <p>4. Is this a manipulative experiment, or an observational one?<br>
      </p>
      <p>5. What did Janet do right? Name at least two good practices in
        experimental design that Janet used in this study.</p>
