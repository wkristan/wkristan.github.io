      <h2 id="correlation" class="part">Introduction</h2>
      <p><img src="Fig1scatterplots750pxw.png" alt="Some correlations" style="width: 373px; height: 127px; margin-right: 10px"
          align="left">We will use the body dimensions data set we have used in
        previous activities to test for correlations in biacromial diameter,
        age, and BMI. </p>
      <p>To analyze the data, do the following:</p>
      <p>1. Open <a href="body_dimensions.MTW">this file</a> with the data on
        body dimensions. In it you'll see measurements of biacromial diameter,
        age, and BMI. Each row of the table is a different person - for
        correlation analysis to work, it's necessary for the measurements from a
        single person to match row for row. There is also a column indicating
        whether the person was male or female.</p>
      <p>2. If you only wanted to look at one pair of variables at a time, we
        could use scatterplots. Produce a scatterplot with regression lines for
        each variable, grouped by sex.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Graph" → "Scatterplot".</li>
        <li>In the window that pops up, select "Simple", then click "OK".</li>
        <li>There are three correlations we can calculate, between biacromial
          diameter and age, biacromial diameter and BMI, and age and BMI. In the
          next window that pops up, put these combinations into the "Y
          variables" and "X variables" boxes, like <a href="correlation2.jpg">this</a>.</li>
        <li>Lastly, click on "Multiple graphs..." and in the "Multiple
          Variables" tab select "In separate panels of the same graph". Click
          "OK" to produce the graphs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The graph that's produced will have three panels, one for each of the
        X,Y variable pairs you specified. The axes are not labeled with this
        type of layout, but the variables are given in the strip above each
        graph, and the first variable listed is the X-axis (so, the Biacromial
        diameter*Age graph uses biacromial diameter for the X-axis, and age for
        the y-axis).</p>
      <p>Another way of getting a plot like this is to use a "Matrix plot".</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Graph" → "Matrix plot", and then use the "Simple" option.</li>
        <li>Put in all of the variables.</li>
        <li>Under "Data view" click on "Regression" and select "Linear". This
          will give us a line through the data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our next step will be to calculate the correlations, and see if they
        are statistically significant.</p>
      <p>3. Now we will calculate the correlations between each pair of
        variables, along with the p-values for each r. </p>
      <p>Use "Stat" → "Basic Statistics", "Correlation". Put all three numeric
        variables into the "Variables" list, and select "Display p-values".
        Click "OK". You'll see a set of rows and columns that give correlations
        between all possible combinations of the three variables. The "Cell
        contents" block at the bottom is telling you what's being reported - for
        each combination of variables (called "cells"), the top number is the
        correlation coefficient and the bottom number is the p-value. </p>
      <p>Copy these over to your worksheet, just like they are reported in
        MINITAB, with the correlation coefficient on top and the p-values below.</p>
      <h2 id="challenge" class="part">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p><img src="leaf1.jpg" alt="Sycamore leaf" style="width: 131px; height: 156px; float: left; padding: 10px;">Leaves
        of the sycamore tree, pictured to the left, were measured for seven
        different measurements: total length, width (at the widest point),
        length of the petiole (i.e. the short stem that attaches the leaf to the
        branch), petiole diameter, length of the longest side, number of primary
        veins, and weight (in grams). All lengths are in mm. The data are <a href="challenge_q_correl.MTW">here</a>.</p>
      <p>1. Which pair of variables has the highest correlation? What is the
        correlation coefficient?</p>
      <p>2. Does the highest correlation indicate a perfect correlation? How do
        you know?</p>
      <p>3. Which pairs of variables are not significantly correlated? What are
        the correlation coefficients?</p>
      <p>4. Look at all of the significant correlations - are the signs all
        positive, all negative, or a mix of positive and negative? Why would
        they show this pattern?</p>
      <p>5. Do a matrix plot for these variables. Are there any pairs of
        variables that do not look like they are linearly correlated (that is,
        the points don't fall along a straight line)?</p>
      <p>6. Based on this analysis, do sycamore leaves only vary in size, or do
        they vary in shape as well? How do you know?</p>
