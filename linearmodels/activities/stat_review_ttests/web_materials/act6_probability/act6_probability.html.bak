      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>This week we will work with probabilities. First, we will explore how
        to estimate probabilities empirically, and why it's necessary to use
        many trials to do so (the "law of large numbers"). Second, we will look
        at inverse probabilities, as they pertain to screening tests for rare
        disorders, such as Down Syndrome. <br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="law large numbers">The Law of Large Numbers</h2>
      <p>We will be dealing with data that is subject to random variation for
        the rest of the semester, but "subject to random variation" is not the
        same thing as "completely unpredictable". It is true that we can only
        make probability statements about data that is subject to random
        variation, but there is a lot that we can know about a system based on
        probabilities. </p>
      <p>Sometimes we know the probabilities of outcomes based on our
        understanding of how randomness works in the system. For example, when
        we toss a coin we know that the probability of each outcome, "Heads" or
        "Tails", is 1/2. We know this because we know something about coin
        tossing - there are two possible outcomes, and each is equally likely to
        occur. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we didn't have this conceptual understanding of
        coin tossing and were instead trying to estimate the probability of a
        Heads based on what we learn from actually tossing a coin, how would we
        do it? This is the <strong>empirical</strong> approach to estimating
        probability.</p>
      <p>If we wanted to empirically estimate the probability of tossing a Heads
        in one coin toss, we would need to toss the coin multiple times and see
        how often it comes up "Heads". Each toss of the coin is a <strong>trial</strong>
        - if we tossed a coin 4 times, we would be conducting four trials. To
        calculate a probability of Heads from our trials, we could count up how
        many times our trials gave us a <strong>success</strong> (which we
        define as the outcome we are estimating the probability of - in this
        case, the coin landing Heads up is a success), and divide by the number
        of trials (4).</p>
      <p>Using this procedure, we would need to get 2 Heads and 2 Tails for our
        empirical estimate of the probability of heads (P(Heads)) to equal what
        we know it to be (0.5). But, with only 4 tosses, there is a good chance
        that instead of 2 Heads we would get 3 heads, for an empirical estimate
        of P(Heads) = 3/4 = 0.75, or even 4 heads, for an empirical estimate of
        P(Heads) = 4/4 = 1. Getting 3 or 4 heads would not be a particularly
        unlikely outcome, but they give us empirical estimates of P(Heads) that
        are very different from the correct value.</p>
      <p>If we tossed a coin 1,000 times, the empirical estimate would equal 0.5
        exactly only if we got 500 Heads and 500 Tails - we wouldn't be too
        surprised if we got a few more or fewer Heads than 500 though due to
        random chance. However, even if we were off by a couple of Heads, such
        that we got 502 Heads and 498 Tails, the empirical estimate would be
        502/1000 = 0.52. To be as far off as we were with only four trials we
        would need to get 750 Heads and 250 Tails for a 0.75 estimate, or 1,000
        Heads and no Tails for an estimate of 1, but neither of these outcomes
        is very likely.</p>
      <p>So, based on this simple example, when we're estimating probabilities
        empirically we need to use large numbers of trials.</p>
      <p>In fact, when we specify a probability of Heads = 1/2, we are making a
        statement about what would happen in an imaginary, mathematically
        perfect world in which we could toss a coin an infinite number of times.
        Although we can never do anything an infinite number of times, we do
        expect our real-world trials to converge on the behavior of infinite
        tosses as the number of trials gets large. This is the <strong>law of
          large numbers</strong>, and it tells us that our actual, empirical
        results should converge on the correct theoretical values as the number
        of trials goes to infinity.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We will make use of this law to empirically calculate probabilities of
        multiple "heads" in a row, occurring within a set of 10 coin tosses. For
        this exercise, a "Trial" is tossing a coin ten times, not tossing it
        once. It turns out that calculating the probability of a string of
        "heads" in a row in 10 tosses is a fairly complicated problem to solve
        mathematically. There are two simple <strong>special cases</strong>
        that are easy: A) 10 H's in a row, and B) at least one H in ten tosses.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The probability of ten H's in a row is an "and" probability - we
            need to get an H in toss 1, and an H in toss 2, and in every toss up
            to the 10th. The multiplication rule tells us to multiply the
            probability of each outcome to get the probability of all of the
            outcomes occurring in a trial - this means the probability of
            HHHHHHHHH = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x
            1/2, or 1/2<sup>10</sup>. The number 2<sup>10</sup> is equal to 1024
            - dividing 1 by 1024 equals p = 0.000977. What is the probability of
            ten T's in a row? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('ten_t')">Click
              here to see if you're right.</a></p>
          <div id="ten_t" style="display:none;">
            <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;clear: both;">Since ten
              T's in a row is also an "and" probability, we would multiply the
              probability of a T (1/2) together 10 times, or 1/2<sup>10</sup>.
              There is only one way to get ten T's in a row, so the probability
              is 1/1024 = 0.000977, just like ten H's in a row.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The probability of one or more H is easiest to solve by calculating
            the probability of the single outcome in which it wouldn't occur,
            which is TTTTTTTTTT. Since the probability of ten T's in a row is
            1/2<sup>10</sup>, the probability of not rolling this sequence is
            also the probability of one or more H, or 1-1/2<sup>10</sup>, which
            equals 0.999023. What do you think the probability of at least one T
            is? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('one_t')">Click here to see
              if you're right.</a></p>
          <div id="one_t" style="display:none;">
            <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;clear: both;">Just like
              with heads, the probability of ten T's is 0.000977, so the
              probability of one or more T is 1 - 0.000997 = 0.999023.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Aside from these two simple cases, strings of other numbers of H's in a
        row become difficult to calculate because there are many more than a
        single way we could obtain them. For example, if we wanted to know the
        probability of tossing at least two H's in a row in 10 tosses, the
        sequence HHTTTTTTTT has two H's in a row, but so does HHTHHTHHTH, and
        HHHHHHHHHH. It turns out that there isn't a simple formula that
        calculates this probability, so instead we will use a computer to
        calculate it empirically.</p>
      <p>According to the Law of Large Numbers, to get results that are accurate
        we need to conduct lots of trials. Since we're working with outcomes
        that can have probabilities as low as 1 in 1024, we need a number of
        trials that's big compared to 1024 - we will simulate 20,000 trials of
        10 coin tosses each (doing this by hand would be tedious, but computers
        excel at doing tedious work). To estimate the probability of a sequence
        of H's or T's that we specify, we just need to conduct 20,000 trials,
        count how many contain the sequence (the number of "successes"), then
        divide the number of successes by the number of trials.</p>
      <p>You will empirically estimate the probability of sequences of H's from
        one to ten in a row. Since we have already calculated the probabilities
        of one H and ten H's, we'll check to make sure our empirical estimates
        are working by comparing the estimates to these two calculated
        probabilities. Once we're confident the method is working, we can
        interpret how increasing the number of H's in a row affects the
        probability that the sequence will occur in ten tosses.</p>

        <p style="clear:both">Probability of the test sequence appearing: <span id="coin_prob">1</span></p>
      </div>
      <p> 1. The simulation to the left generates 20,000 random sets
        of 10 coin tosses, counts up how many contain the test sequence entered,
        and then divides them to 20,000 to calculate the probability of the test
        sequence appearing. Initially H is entered as a test sequence, so the p
        you will get is the probability of a single H appearing in 10 tosses. We
        are expecting a probability of 0.999, your result should be close to
        that (it won't be identical because we are using a simulation that is
        subject to random chance - if the rounded value is within 0.001 of this
        result consider it a match). </p>
      <p>2. The other sequence we calculated above was the probability of ten
        H's in a row. Enter ten H's as the "Test sequence", and record the
        probability on your worksheet. It should be close to the 0.000977 value
        that we calculated, above (again, it should match rounded to about the
        third decimal place, 0.001).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 3. Now that we have some reason to think this thing is working, you
        can try the rest of the test sequences. Enter each test sequence one at
        a time, and record the probability estimate you get on your assignment
        sheet. </p>
      <p>What do you think will happen to the probabilities as you increase the
        number of H's in a row? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('more_h')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a></p>
      <div id="more_h" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px; clear: both">The total number
          of trials is the same every time (20,000) so the only reason the
          probabilities would change is if a different number of trials match
          the test sequence. With a single H there are many ways to match the
          sequence - any H in any position is a match. With two H's there are
          fewer ways to match - there has to be an HH in one or more positions
          to match. With three H's there are still fewer ways to match - there
          has to be at least one HHH in the sequence. Each time an H is added to
          the sequence there are fewer ways to match, until we get to
          HHHHHHHHHH, which can only occur in one way. Since the number of ways
          for the outcome to occur goes down each time we add an H, the
          probability of a match should go down as well.</p>
      </div>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 4. We selected a class test sequence, which you recorded on your
        worksheet. Enter this as a test sequence and record its probability.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> It certainly seems like a sequence that looks decidedly non-random,
        like HHHHHHHHHH, should be much harder to get than some random jumble of
        H's and T's, like the class sequence we selected. Was it?</p>

      <p> The simulation to the left is a table showing the (instructor
        generated) results of a study of effectiveness of the triple test as a
        screening test for Down syndrome. Although the data themselves are not
        real, they were generated to reflect the reported sensitivity (i.e. true
        positive rate) and false positive rate for this test. The rows of the
        table give the DS status of the fetuses as either DS or No DS. </p>
      <p>Before you make any changes, the numbers in the table are set to
        reflect a study of the effectiveness of the triple test for screening
        for DS. Because this is a study to assess the accuracy of the screening
        test, the actual DS status of every woman in the table would be
        established using amniocentesis, which is essentially 100% accurate.
        Each woman would then also be given the triple test. In clinical terms,
        a "positive" result on the triple test means the test indicates a DS
        fetus, whereas a "negative" result indicates that the test indicates a
        No DS pregnancy (in medical terms, "positive" means that the test
        indicates the presence of the disorder you are testing for). By design,
        there is an equal number of women with or without a DS pregnancy - which
        is a good feature of experimental design - why? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('why_balanced')">Click

      <h3>Probabilities based on the "study data"</h3>
      <p>Let's start with the data as it initially appears - this is the "study
        of effectiveness of trip test section" referred to on your worksheet.</p>
      <p> 1. Let's first just check that we're learning something from doing the
        test. If the test result is indicating DS status, then DS status should
        depend on the test result. To assess this we need to calculate the
        marginal probability of DS, and then the conditional probability of DS
        given a positive test - if these are the same number then DS status is
        independent of the test result. If DS status was independent of the test
        result that would mean that your chances of having DS are the same if
        you get a positive test and if you don't take the test at all - this
        would be a good indication that the test was not working at all. If
        P(DS) and P(DS | Positive) are different, then the DS status depends on
        the test result, and as long as P(DS | Positive) is bigger than P(DS),
        the test result is giving us information about DS status.</p>
      <p>Calculate the marginal probability of DS from the study population -
        drop down the menu under "DS" and set it to "Marginal". A marginal
        probability is the total number of times that DS occurred, divided by
        the total number of women in the study. The color coding in the table
        and in the probability reported will show you how the calculation is
        done.</p>
      <p>2. Next, calculate the inverse probability of being a DS patient if you
        receive a Positive test result, or P(DS | Positive). To do a conditional
        probability, you need to set a "Given", which is the outcome that comes
        after the vertical line - the given is already known to have occurred,
        and we are not calculating its probability. Then, set the outcome whose
        probability you are calculating as "Conditional", which is DS. You'll
        see that when you set Positive as "Given" its entire column is shaded
        gray to indicate that we only need to consider the data in the
        "Positive" column if we know already that we've received a positive test
        result. The conditional probability of DS given a positive result is the
        number of times the pregnancy actually was DS after a positive test
        result was obtained, divided by the number of positive test results
        (60/65).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. The <strong>sensitivity</strong> is already entered as 0.6 in the
        simulation, but let's see where that number is coming from.</p>
      <p>Sensitivity is a standard measure of how well a screening test is
        working, and it is a conditional probability - namely, it is the
        probability of a positive test result given that the pregnancy is
        actually DS. Symbolically, sensitivity is P(Positive | DS). The vertical
        line tells us we already know DS status, so set DS as the "Given" - we
        are only interested in the DS row of the table. It is the probability of
        testing positive that we calculate - set DS as the "Conditional". Check
        that the conditional probability of Positive given DS matches the
        sensitivity reported in the simulation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 4. Another standard measure of effectiveness is the <strong>false
          positive rate</strong>.</p>
      <p>The false positive rate is the probability that a patient that is known
        not to have the condition will incorrectly test positive. This too is a
        conditional probability, P(Positive | No DS), and the vertical line
        tells us we only need to pay attention to the No DS row, because we know
        the patient doesn't have a DS pregnancy. This probability is calculated
        as the number of positive tests in the No DS row divided by the total
        number of No DS patients. Do the calculation and check that it matches
        the false positive rate reported in the simulation.</p>
      <p>Sensitivity and false positive rate are classic <strong>researcher's
          questions</strong>, because they both require us to already know the
        DS status of the patient. When a patient takes the triple test, she will
        know the test result but will not know her actual DS status (if she knew
        that, the screening test would be unnecessary). The probability you
        calculated in step 2 to test for independence between DS status and test
        result is a <strong>patient's question</strong>, namely: if I get a
        positive test result, what is the probability that I have a DS
        pregnancy?</p>
      <p>If you think about what the patient's question is asking, what is the
        given? What is it the probability of (DS status, or test result)? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('patient_q')">Click
          here to see if you're right.</a><span style="color: #0000ee;"></span></p>
      <div id="patient_q" style="display:none;">
        <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;clear: both;">If she knows her
          test result, positive, that's the given. We are calculating the
          probability of the outcome that isn't known yet, which is the
          probability that the pregnancy is DS.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Notice that sensitivity and the patient's question both use the same
        terms, but put them in different places. Sensitivity, P(Positive | DS),
        treats DS status as a given, and calculates the probability of a
        positive test result when the DS status is known to be DS. The patient's
        question, P(DS | Positive), treats the test result as a given, and
        calculates the probability of DS after a positive test is obtained. Even
        though the same terms are used, one is a probability of DS, and the
        other is a probability of a positive test result, and as you can now see
        the numbers are not the same.</p>
      <p>At least, though, things are looking good for the triple test - based
        on the study population's data the probability of having a DS pregnancy
        given a positive test result is 0.9231, which is much higher than the
        sensitivity of the test of 0.6. It looks like getting a positive test
        result is very informative, based on these results.</p>
      <p>But, there's a problem - the study population has a really high rate of
        DS; according to the P(DS) you calculated, the rate of DS in the
        population is 0.5. When the test is actually used on the general
        population the rate is much lower - and this turns out to make a huge
        difference in the answer to the patient's question. Let's see how huge,
        and why.</p>
      <h3>Triple test applied to the general population</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In actual human populations, DS is a rare disorder, occurring in only
        1 in 1000 pregnancies. We can see how making just this one change
        affects the probabilities we calculated in the previous step.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 5. First, we need to change the setup to reflect the DS rate in the
        general population. Leave the simulation set to the patient's question -
        the conditional probability of DS given a positive test result - as you
        make the following change.</p>
      <p>Change the "DS rate:" to have a 1 for the first entry, and a 1000 for
        the second - this sets the DS rate to 1 in 1000, and you'll see that the
        table automatically updates to reflect this new rate. There will be a 1
        as the marginal total for DS, a 999 as the marginal total for No DS, and
        1000 as the grand total.</p>
      <p>Note that the numbers in the body of the table are being calculated
        from the sensitivity and false positive rates, which are set to 0.6 and
        0.05, respectively. The only thing you changed was the DS rate, and
        neither the sensitivity nor false positive rates changed at all.
        Sensitivity was used to put 60% of DS pregnancies into the positive test
        result column, and therefore 40% were put into the negative test result
        column. Likewise the false positive rate of 5% was used to put 5% of the
        No DS pregnancies into the positive column, and 95% of No DS pregnancies
        were put into the negative column. In other words, the test is working
        just as well as before, as far as the researcher's questions are
        concerned.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 6. Note what happened to P(DS | Positive) - it is now a very small
        number. This is telling you that when you apply the triple test to the
        general population the answer to the patient's question is much less
        certain.</p>
      <p>Since the only thing that changed was the rate of DS in the population
        that must be why P(DS | Positive) changed. Now we need to think about
        why that happens.</p>
      <p>The conditional probability P(DS | Positive) is telling us that we only
        need to consider the positive test results. There are two ways to get a
        positive test result - <strong>true positives</strong> (i.e. positives
        received by women who actually have a DS pregnancy) and <strong>false
          positives</strong> (i.e. positives received by women who have a No DS
        pregnancy), and the probability P(DS | Positive) is calculated as the
        proportion of positive test results that are true positives. Changing
        the DS rate affects this probability because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The relative number of <em>true</em> positives <strong>decreases</strong>.
          Only women with DS pregnancies get true positive test results. In the
          study population 1/2 of the women have DS pregnancies, so 1/2 of the
          women in the population are able to contribute true positive tests. In
          the general population only 1 woman in 1000 actually has a DS
          pregnancy, so many fewer true positives could occur.</li>
        <li>The relative number of <em>false</em> positives <strong>increases</strong>.
          Only women with No DS pregnancies can get false positive test results.
          In the study population 1/2 of the women have No DS pregnancies, so
          only 1/2 of the women in the population are able to contribute false
          positives. But, in the general population 999 out of 1000 women have
          No DS pregnancies, which will greatly increase the number of false
          positives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With fewer true positives, and more false positives, the probability
        P(DS | Positive) goes way down.</p>
      <p>7. While you're at it, also calculate the marginal probability of DS,
        P(DS), for the general population - this is the number of women with DS
        divided by the total number of women. You'll see that this is the DS
        rate in the population, 1 in 1000 = 0.001.</p>
      <p>So, let's focus now on what we could do to make the test work better.</p>
      <h3 class="part">Potential for improvement of the triple test</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 8. Things are looking pretty bad for the test, so we are going to look
        at ways we could improve its performance.</p>
      <p>Since the probability we're looking at, P(DS | Positive), is based just
        on the Positive column, we can focus on the two ways that we can get
        positive test results. We have two rates that indicate how well the test
        is working, sensitivity and false positive rate. We will try changing
        each of them to see how P(DS | Positive) changes - we want P(DS |
        Positive) to be as big as possible, so if changing sensitivity or false
        positive rate increases P(DS | Positive) we are improving the
        performance of the test.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Start with sensitivity. Being right only 60% of the time leaves lots
        of room for improvement. The best sensitivity possible would be 1, which
        means the disease is always detected when it's present. Change the test
        sensitivity to 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1 and record P(DS | Positive) at each
        sensitivity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Once you're done with the sensitivities, <span style="font-weight: bold;">change
          sensitivity back to 0.6</span>. </p>
      <p>Next, try improving false positive rate. The best false positive rate
        we could have is zero, which means the test is never positive for No DS
        pregnancies. Change false positive rate to 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, and
        0, and for each one record the P(DS | Positive) on your worksheet. You
        should see that, even though we could only improve false positive rate
        by 5%, it has a much bigger effect on P(DS | Positive) than improving
        sensitivity does.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 9. Answer the remaining question on your worksheet about inverse
        probability.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> You've probably seen pictures of hand prints on cave walls, like the
        one on the left side of this image, made by prehistoric artists. Cave
        paintings of this kind are found in a variety of places, including
        Australia, South America, and Indonesia, and hand prints from these
        areas date from the Neolithic (approximately 8500 BC) to modern times.
        Hand prints found in western Europe caves are even older, dating to the
        upper Paleolithic (about 10,000 BC). The prints are made by placing
        one's palm on the cave wall, and then blowing pigment through a straw
        over the back of the hand to leave a negative impression. The position
        of the thumb makes it easy to tell which hand was used for which part of
        this task, and two researchers (C. Faurie and M. Raymond) did a study in
        which they compared the handedness of upper Paleolithic hand prints from
        caves ni France and Spain to handedness in classes of students. They
        gave students paper, straws, and (non-toxic) pigment to create their own
        hand prints. The researchers did not tell the students which hands to
        use, and so students were free to choose whichever hand seemed most
        natural for accomplishing the task. The data on paleolithic and modern
        hand prints, taken from their paper in Biology Letters (2003,
        271:S43-S45) is given here:</p>
