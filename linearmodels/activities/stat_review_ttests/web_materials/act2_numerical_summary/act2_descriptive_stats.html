      <p>Today we are going to work with summary statistics as a way to
        understand data. We have <a href="body_dimensions.MTW">data</a> on the
        following measurements for a collection of adults:</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Biacromial diameter - measured from shoulder to shoulder in
                  cm, as shown</li>
                <li>Age in years</li>
                <li>Sex, either M or F</li>
                <li>Body mass index (BMI) - this is weight in kg divided by
                  height in meters squared</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
            <td><img alt="Dimensions" src="biacromial.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>As you know, the appropriate summary for a data set depends on the
        variable type (categorical or numeric). Further, for numeric variables
        the correct set of summary statistics to use depends on the shape of the
        distribution - symmetrical distributions can be summarized adequately by
        a mean and a standard deviation, but skewed distributions are better
        represented by medians (instead of means), and a more natural measure of
        dispersion for a median is the interquartile range (instead of a
        standard deviation). You also should know by now that you can detect
        skew by looking at histograms and at five number summaries. Histograms
        that are asymmetrical are skewed - if you locate the tallest bars to use
        as a central position, the tail of the histogram that is longest
        indicates the direction of the skew. For the five number summary, uneven
        spacing of the numbers on either side of the median indicates skew, and
        the numbers with the bigger spacing indicate the direction of the skew.</p>
      <p> Even though all of the measurements we're working with are taken from
        the same set of people, they are not all the same variable type, and
        even for the numeric variables we can't assume they will all have the
        same shape of distribution - some may be symmetrical, others skewed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="cat">Categorical variable</h2>
      <p>Calculate the frequency distribution for the Sex column. This is done
        by: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select Stat → Tables → Tally individual variables</li>
        <li>Put Sex in the Variables: list. Notice that all of the variables in
          the data set are listed on the left side of the window, because you
          are allowed to use either text or numeric variables here. But, we
          wouldn't want to count up frequencies of continuous numeric variables
          (do you remember why? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('cont_freq')">Click
            here to see if you're right.</a>
          <div id="cont_freq" style="display:none;">
            <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;">Frequencies are counts
              of how many times data values appear in a data set, and continuous
              numbers may not repeat at all.</p>
          </div>
          ), so not all of the variables <em>should</em> be used, even if any
          of them could be.</li>
        <li>Put a check next to counts, and next to percents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Percentages and relative frequencies are related, but they aren't the
        same thing. Relative frequencies are proportions (a part divided by the
        whole), and percentages are proportions multiplied by 100. When you
        record relative frequencies on your worksheet, report them as
        proportions.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="discrete numeric">Discrete numeric</h2>
      <p>The summary statistics that are appropriate for numerical variables
        depend on the shape of the distribution. For discrete data, we can
        assess shape with a frequency distribution. </p>
      <p>To obtain a frequency distribution for the Age column, tally the Age
        variable as you did with the Sex variable, but this time just ask for
        counts (un-check Percents).</p>
      <p>Look at the pattern of frequencies (in column Count) for the ages (in
        column Age). Answer the questions on the worksheet about these
        frequencies.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="continuous numeric">Continuous numeric</h2>
      <p>We will use histograms to diagnose the shapes of the numeric variables,
        and then we will pick summary statistics that are appropriate for each.
        We will use a histogram for Age as well, even though it is discrete, to
        facilitate comparison with Biacromial and BMI.</p>
      <p>We should expect that men and women may have different distributions
        for all of these variables, so we should look at the shapes of the
        distributions for the sexes separately. Fortunately, we can get MINITAB
        to separate them easily.</p>
      <p>1. Select Graph → Histogram. Use the default, Simple, and click OK. </p>
      <p>In the Histogram: Simple window, select all of the numeric variables as
        Graph variables. Now, click on "Multiple Graphs". In the "Multiple
        Variables" tab, change "Show Graph Variables" to "In separate panels of
        the same graph"; this will put the histogram for each into the same
        graph window, which will make them easier to keep track of. Next, switch
        to the "By Variables" tab, and put Sex into the lower box ("By variables
        with groups on separate graphs"); this will cause MINITAB to make a
        different set of graphs for males and females.</p>
      <p>Click OK for both windows, and you will see your graphs.</p>
      <p>2. Calculate the five-number summary for Age and for Biacromial
        diameter. The five-number summary is minimum, first quartile, median,
        third quartile, and maximum. You can get these in Stat → Basic
        Statistics → Display Descriptive Statistics.</p>
      <p>Put in Biacromial diameter and age as "Variables", and Sex as "By
        variables". Then, click on "Statistics..." and select just the five
        numbers we want (un-select everything else). Click OK to get your
        summary.</p>
      <p>You can see that based on these numbers Biacromial diameter is fairly
        symmetrically distributed, but Age is not.</p>
      <p>3. Calculate summary statistics, and report the ones that are most
        appropriate for each variable. For symmetrical distributions, report the
        mean and the standard deviation. For skewed distributions, report the
        median and the interquartile range.</p>
      <h2 class="part">Interpreting the standard deviation</h2>
      <p>You know from your lecture and from your reading before class that the
        standard deviation gives us information beyond a measure of the relative
        dispersion in the data. We can use the standard deviation to make
        predictions about the range of data values that should be found in the
        population we are studying. Use this table to answer the final questions
        in the worksheet.</p>

      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge question</h2>
      <p>Starting this week there will be a challenge question at the end of
        each activity. These are optional, but they are taken from exams from
        previous semesters, and they will give you practice answering the kinds
        of questions you will see on the midterms and final. You are encouraged
        to use these to help you prepare for exams.</p>
      <h3> Numerical summary question</h3>
      <p> Radley studies a species of fly that occurs in both tropical areas
        (like the Amazonian rainforest) and in temperate areas (like San Diego).
        He suspects that flies that live in our dry region have better
        resistance to water loss compared with tropical populations that
        experience much higher humidities. To test this he weighs flies from
        each region, puts them in a chamber with very low humidity for 1 hour,
        and then weighs them again. The difference in beginning weight and
        ending weight is the amount of water lost by the flies. </p>
      <p> The data on water loss is in <a href="question2.MTW">this file</a>.
        The “Location” column identifies the population the fly belongs to, and
        “Water loss” gives milligrams of water lost by each fly.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> A. Make a histogram of water loss, and describe the shape
        (“Combined”). Then, make a separate histogram for each population (use
        the “With Groups” histogram type, ask me if you can't find it) and
        describe the shape for each population separately.</p>
      <p> Combined: _________Temperate:_______ Tropical:_______ </p>
      <p> Why is the shape different when you combined the populations than when
        you make a separate graph for each?</p>
      <p>B. Report the five-number summary for each group.</p>
