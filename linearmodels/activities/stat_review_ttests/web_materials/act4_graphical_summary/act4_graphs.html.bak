      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Graphing data</h2>
      <p>Today you will learn how to use various graph types. We will use data
        from a study of wild <a href="bears.MTW"> bears</a> for most of our
        graphing.</p>
      <p>If you download and open the data set, you will see it has some
        categorical variables (sex, name), some discrete numeric variables (age,
        month), and some continuous numeric variables (head length, head width,
        neck girth, length, chest girth, and weight). Observation number and ID
        are both just identifiers. You will graph several of these variables
        with appropriate graph types.</p>
      <p>In the last part of the exercise you will graph some data on heights of
        mountains that are 4,000 m or taller in the United States to see how
        choices of graph type can affect our impressions of the data. This will
        help you avoid making graphical choices that look good, but that obscure
        the important features of the data.</p>
      <p>Make sure you copy and paste copies of all your graphs into a Word
        document to print - feel free to shrink them all to fit on one page.
        Attach a printout to your worksheet.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="freqs">Graphing frequencies</h2>
      <p>We can plot the number of observations each month using a <strong>bar
          chart</strong>.</p>
      <p>1. Select Graph → Bar chart. In the Bar Charts window, keep the default
        Counts of unique values (which will count up the frequencies for each
        month), and select Simple as the type. Click OK.</p>
      <p>2. Next, construct the chart by putting "Month" into the "Categorical
        variables:" list. Click OK to get the chart.</p>
      <p>If you look at the bar chart you just made, you'll see that the months
        are in alphabetical order. The x-axis on a bar chart is categorical, and
        by default MINITAB presents categorical variables in alphabetical order,
        in text output in the Session window as well as on categorical axes of a
        graph.</p>
      <p>MINITAB can deal with ordinal categories, but you have to tell it the
        order you want to use. This is done by assigning a "value order" to the
        column "Month" in the data sheet. </p>
      <p>3. Switch to the data worksheet, and right-click on the "Month" column.
        Select "Column properties" → "Value order".</p>
      <p>4. In the value order settings window, you'll see you can either use
        alphabetical order (the default, which we don't want), the order of
        occurrence in the worksheet, or a "User-specified order", which is what
        we want - select that option.</p>
      <p>In the "Choose an order:" list, there are several common ones (days of
        the week and months), as well as "NEW ORDER". For us, we have
        non-abbreviated names of months, so you can select the set of ordered
        months from the list rather than needing to define our own - <a href="value_order.png">like
          this</a> - and then click "OK". Nothing will appear to happen, but now
        MINITAB knows how to sort the months.</p>
      <p>If you had an ordinal variable with categories that didn't occur in the
        list, you could select "NEW ORDER" and type in the order of the
        categories you want to use.</p>
      <p>5. Make another bar chart of "Month". You should see that the months
        are in chronological order, instead of alphabetical order.</p>
      <p>In the new version of MINITAB we are using, if we entered the data from
        scratch it would recognize we were entering month names, and would
        assign a "Date" data type to the column (you would see a -D after the
        column number instead of a -T), and it would automatically sort the
        months appropriately. Since our month column is text MINITAB didn't
        assume we meant the variable to be treated as months of the year, and
        used its default alphabetical sort order.</p>
      <p>The nice thing about assigning the order to the variable in the
        worksheet rather than just applying it to the x-axis on a graph is that
        MINITAB will use the order you assign any time you use the variable,
        even if you used month as a grouping variable for calculating summary
        statistics.</p>
      <h3>Plotting relative frequencies - bar chart</h3>
      <p>1. To plot relative frequencies, you just need to change the y-axis to
        a percent scale. Select the bars by left-clicking once on one of them,
        then right-click and choose Graph options. Set the "Percent and
        Accumulate" setting to "Show Y as Percent". Click OK to see your graph
        on a relative scale.</p>
      <h3>Plotting relative frequencies - pie chart</h3>
      <p>You can plot the number of observations each month using a <strong>pie
          chart</strong> instead.</p>
      <p>1. Select Graph → Pie chart. Use "Month" as the categorical variables,
        and use "Chart counts of unique values". Click OK. The sizes of the pie
        slices are in proportion to the relative frequencies of observations for
        each month.</p>
      <h2 class="part">Graphically summarizing continuous variables</h2>
      <h3 class="part" id="histo">Using histograms</h3>
      <div id="wrapper_div1" style="float: left; border: solid black 4px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 605px;">
        <div id="chart_div1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px; float: left"></div>
        <div id="controls_div" style="float: right; clear: both; margin-right: 30px">
          <p>Select the number of bins to use: <input id="n_bins" min="3" max="300"
              value="13" onchange="drawChart1()" style="width: 60px" type="number"></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Histograms are a good way to start analysis of a continuous variable,
        because they help us diagnose skewness and more than one modes in our
        data. But, we do have to be aware that our impression of the
        distribution of the data depends on choices we make about how to bin the
        data. </p>
      <p>To start, let's take a look at how the choice of bin width affects the
        shape of a histogram. Before you make a change the histogram shows the
        bear weight data using the same number of bins that MINITAB uses by
        default, 13. The choice of 13 bars is based on an algorithm that tries
        to find the best number of bins for a data set, but it's not the only
        possible choice. You can use the graph here to explore how changing the
        number of bins changes the appearance of the distribution.</p>
      <p style="clear: both"> Specifically, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Find the number of bins that gives you the best result - that is,
            shows two modes that are approached smoothly on either side, without
            jaggedness in the heights of the bins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Then, increase the number of bins to the maximum the graph will
            allow (300). With a large number of bins the details of the data set
            start to dominate, and there will be only a few data values
            contained in each bin (you can hover over the bars to see what they
            are - the segments for each bar are a single data point). With a
            large number of tiny bins, the overall bimodal shape becomes harder
            to see - jaggedness in the heights of the bars, or spaces between
            them, are signs that you're losing sight of the overall shape of the
            distribution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Finally, decrease the number of bins until you no longer see a
            clear second mode - the shape will look right-skewed if you use few
            enough bars.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>MINITAB's histograms<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Now that you have in mind a general understanding of why the choice of
        bin width matters, let's see how to change the binning in MINITAB. </p>
      <p>A. Use the Weight column to make a histogram - select "<a href="s2_graph_histo.png">Graph"
          → "Histogram".</a></p>
      <p> B. Choose "<a href="s3_simple.png">Simple" and click "OK".</a></p>
      <p> C. Select the variable "Weight" as the graph variable, and click OK.</p>
      <p> E. MINITAB will plot a histogram for you (it should look like <a href="histogram_bear_weight.png">this</a>),
        with the default number of bins. Save a copy to turn in. </p>
      <p> F. Now you will change the number of bins. Double click on the
        histogram bars, and <a href="s6_binning.png">select the "Binning" tab</a>
        from the dialog that pops up. You can see that you can change the number
        of bins here, and produce graphs like we did with the applet, above. You
        can close this without making any changes.</p>
      <p>Answer the questions on your worksheet about histograms based on the
        graph above, and on MINITAB's default choice of bins.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="interval plot"> Interval plots</h3>
      <p>Interval plots are best for data that are symmetrically distributed
        around the mean. Symmetrical distributions of data are represented well
        by just the mean and the standard deviation, and interval plots are
        constructed in this way - the mean is represented by a plot symbol in
        the middle, and the "error bars" around the plot symbol can be used to
        represent 1 or 2 standard deviations around the mean. This is a really
        compact display, so interval plots are a good way of putting the means
        for two or more groups next to each other so that they can be easily
        compared. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, MINITAB doesn't give us the ability to plot standard
        deviations in interval plots. Our choices for an interval plot are
        either the 95% confidence interval or the standard error, both of which
        pertain to sampling issues rather than variability in the data set
        (we'll learn all about them starting next week). But, for now this just
        means we can't get the graph we want in MINITAB. If you are trying to
        focus on the distribution of the data, boxplots are a better choice than
        MINITAB's interval plots, because the standard error and confidence
        interval are about distributions of sample means, not of individual data
        points (more on that next week).</p>
      <p>So, if you want an interval plot that uses standard deviations, MINITAB
        is not for you. Excel can make interval plots with standard deviations,
        with some effort. If you want to try them, follow the instructions <a href="Interval%20plots%20in%20Excel.html">here</a>.
        An interval plot for head length I made in Excel is <a href="interval_plot_excel.png">here</a>,
        as an example. You can see the differences in mean, but there is a great
        deal of overlap between the sexes in head lengths, because the error
        bars overlap quite a bit.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="boxplot">Boxplots</h3>
      <p>Boxplots are good choices for any numeric variable, even symmetrical
        ones, but you definitely should use them if the data are skewed. Try a
        box plot for chest girth.</p>
      <p>1. Select Graph → Boxplot, and choose the "With Groups" option from the
        "One Y" row. Use "Chest Girth" as the "Graph variables", and "Sex" as
        the "Categorical variables for grouping".</p>
      <p>Since the box is constructed from the first quartile, median, and third
        quartile you can see whether the variable is skewed by how off-center
        the middle of the box is. The longer half of the box points in the
        direction of the skew.</p>
      <p>If there are no outliers, the ends of the whiskers are the maximum and
        minimum, and the box and whiskers together are the five number summary.
        If there are outliers, the whiskers are the smallest and largest data
        points that aren't outliers.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="good graph">Good practices in graphical display of
        summary statistics</h2>
      <p>You will use a chart type called the "Individual value plot" to display
        the heights of mountains that are 4,000 m or more in the United States.
        The data are expressed in two ways, as elevations above sea level (the
        traditional way of recording heights of mountains) and as distance from
        the center of the planet (a decidedly non-traditional, but still valid
        way of recording heights of mountains). The earth has a radius of
        6,371,000 m on average, and the heights of the mountains were converted
        to distances from the center of the earth by simply adding 6,371,000 to
        each elevation (note that this isn't quite correct - the earth isn't
        perfectly spherical, but it's close enough for our purposes). All this
        does is to change the baseline we're using to measure heights of
        mountains, it doesn't change the heights of the mountains relative to
        one another at all, and all the interesting patterns in the data (i.e.
        differences in means between states, differences in amount of variation
        in heights among states) should be visible with both data sets if we
        pick the right type of graph. As you'll see, though, the choice of
        baseline makes a huge difference if we choose the wrong kind of graph. </p>
      <p>A. Download <a href="peaks_over_4km.MTW">this</a> file and open it.
        You will see a worksheet with three columns, State, Elevation, and Dist
        from center.</p>
      <p>B. Select "<a href="ivplot1.png">Graph" → "Individual value plot</a>",
        and select the "<a href="ivplot2.png">With Groups</a>" option with "One
        Y".</p>
      <p> C. In the next dialog box, select "Elevation" and "Dist from center"
        for the "<a href="ivplot3.png">Graph variable</a>", and "State" for the
        "categorical variable". Click on "Multiple Graphs" and then in the
        "Multiple Variables" tab click on "<a href="ivplot3b.png">In separate
          panels of the same graph</a>". Click OK to create the initial graph.</p>
      <p> D. Add a mean symbol. Click on a point so that the data are selected
        (black squares will surround each data point). Right-click on your
        mouse, and select "<a href="ivplot4.png">Add" → "Data display</a>" from
        the popup menu. Click on the box next to "<a href="mean_symbol.jpeg">Mean
          symbol</a>" and click "OK". This will indicate where the mean is for
        each year.</p>
      <p>Print a copy of this first graph, without bars (copy and paste into
        Word, if you want to print multiple graphs on the same page). The plot
        is showing all of the individual duration values from your data, with
        one point per row in the table.</p>
      <p>E. Click on a point so that the data are selected, right-click on your
        mouse, and select "<a href="ivplot4.png">Add" → "Data display</a>" from
        the popup menu.</p>
      <p>F. Click the check box next to "<a href="ivplot5.png">Bar</a>" and
        click "OK". You now will have the same data as before, but with a bar
        extending from zero to the mean value for each group. Print this graph
        (copy and paste into Word).</p>
      <p>G. Answer the questions on the assignment sheet.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge question</h2>
      <p><a href="bumpus.MTW">This file </a>gives various measurements from
        house sparrows that a biologist named Herman Bumpus at Tufts University
        found on the ground after a late winter storm. The measurements include
        total length, wingspan, weight, length of the beak and head, three bone
        measurements (length of the humerus in the wing, and length of the femur
        and the tibiotarsus in the leg), and a length of the keel (which is an
        extension on the sternum that flight muscles attach to). Additionally,
        he sexed the birds (m for male, f for female), and although all were
        found on the ground some died and some recovered after they warmed up,
        so he recorded their survival status (dead or alive).</p>
      <p>1. What kind of graph should you use to display the proportion or
        percentage of birds that were males? Which of your options gives you an
        axis to read the proportions or percentages off of?</p>
      <p>2. Use a histogram for each variable to determine the shapes. Are any
        strongly skewed? Do any have a bimodal distribution?</p>
      <p>3. Look at the histogram for length of humerus - what is the mode,
        based on the binned data?</p>
      <p>4. Calculate the mode for length of humerus using Display Descriptives.
        MINITAB finds modes by counting numbers of repeated data values.
        According to Display Descriptives, what are the modes? Which is more
        reliable for a continuous variable like length of humerus, finding a
        mode based on the binned data on a histogram, or by counting repeats?
        Why?</p>
      <p>5. Pick a suitable summary graph for length of humerus. Which did you
        select, and why?</p>
