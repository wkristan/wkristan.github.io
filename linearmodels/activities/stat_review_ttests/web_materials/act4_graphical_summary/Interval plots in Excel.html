    <h1>Making interval plots in Excel</h1>
    <p>Although Excel can make interval plots, it isn't a standard plot type,
      and we will need to modify another plot type to coax Excel into giving us
      what we want.</p>
    <p>1. Copy the two columns Sex and Head length from MINITAB, open Excel, and
      paste into the first two columns.</p>
    <p>2. Select one of the cells in the pasted data in Excel, and start a pivot
      table (Insert tab, Pivot Table).</p>
    <p>Use Sex as the "Row Labels" - you can grab the Sex label and drop it in
      the Rows portion of the blank table on the left of the screen.</p>
    <p>Use head length as "&#931; Values" - drag head length into "&#931; Values" at the
      bottom right of the screen. Put head length in twice, and change the first
      to Average, and the second to StdDev - you can do this by double-clicking
      on the name and then selecting the statistic you want from the settings.</p>
    <p>You should now have a pivot table with means and standard deviations for
      head length, like <a href="excel_pivot.png">this</a>.</p>
    <p>3. Select the cells in the pivot table, copy, and past-special as values
      below the pivot table, but in the same worksheet (right-click, select
      Paste special, and then Paste Values). If we try to graph from the pivot
      table directly we end up with a "pivot chart", which won't let us do what
      we want to do.</p>
    <p>Change the column headings to Sex, Mean, and Std.Dev.</p>
    <p>4. Select the sexes and means, including the column headings, and on the
      Insert tab select the "Line" chart type. We don't actually want a line
      chart, but line charts have categorical x-axes (which we want), and if you
      choose the option with dots connected by lines you will have a dot at each
      mean.</p>
    <p>The default chart will look like <a href="basic_line_graph.png">this</a>.
      Not what we want yet, but a good start.</p>
    <p>5. Select the line connecting the two means. The ribbon will change to
      show "Chart Tools" - switch to the "Layout" chart tool tab. You will see
      "Error Bars" in an "Analysis" group towards the right of the ribbon. If
      you click on the Error Bars option, you'll see that standard deviation is
      one of the options, but selecting it won't work. Instead, select "More
      error bars options".</p>
    <p>In the "Format Error Bars" window, you'll want "Both" for direction. In
      "Error Amount", we will want to specify the standard deviations we
      calculated ourselves as the error amount, so click on the "Custom" button,
      and then "Specify Value".</p>
    <p>In the "Custom Error Bars" window, you can select the two cells holding
      the standard deviations with your mouse, once for the Positive Error
      Value, and once for the Negative Error Value. You'll see you now have
      means 1 sd error bars on your graph.</p>
    <p>6. Get rid of the elements you don't need, and clean up the rest. For
      example, you don't need the line connecting the means, so double-click on
      it, and under "Line Color" select "No line".</p>
    <p>You don't need the horizontal grid lines (I loathe them, personally, but
      you may not share my aversion). Select one of them and you'll see the
      whole set is selected - hit the delete key and they disappear.</p>
    <p>You can do the same with the legend - this is used when you have
      different colors or plot symbols that need to be interpreted, but you
      don't have those with this graph. Select the legend, and hit delete.</p>
    <p>The title is set to "Mean", which isn't very informative. You can edit
      this directly - change it to read "Head lengths of bears".</p>
    <p>Finally, the y-axis needs some work. By default the y-axis scale starts
      at 0, but you don't really need it to. Double-click on the axis, and
      change the Minimum from "Auto" to "Fixed", and give it a number just below
      the lowest error bar (like 10). The Maximum can be set to 17.</p>
    <p>You can also add a label to the y-axis - under "Layout", you'll see an
      "Axis Titles" option in the "Labels" group. Select "Primary vertical axis"
      -&gt; "Rotated title". A generic "Axis Title" is added to the graph, which
      you can edit directly to read "Head Length".</p>
    <p>And, you have a nice interval plot with standard deviations. Took some
      work, but it's just what we needed (unlike the version we could have
      gotten in MINITAB).</p>
