        Regression</h2>
      <p>In today's lab we are going to use linear regression to test how our
        visual acuity declines with distance. Generally, we expect to have more
        difficulty resolving objects as we get further from them, but we will
        test this with a simple vision test today in class. </p>
      <p>Your instructor will project a randomly generated sequence of
        characters on the screen at the front of the class. The characters are
        the different "suits" from a deck of cards: hearts<span style="font-family: Wingdings;"></span>,
        diamonds, clubs, and spades. Sizes of characters decline from the top to
        the bottom. Each student will be assigned a distance to stand from the
        screen, found <a href="Positions_sp16.html">here</a>, and pairs of
        students will take turns reading characters from the screen. One student
        should read the characters while the partner records correct and
        incorrect answers on an answer sheet, then switch roles so that everyone
        has a chance to take the test. </p>
      <p>Record the total number of <strong>correct answers</strong>, and
        report this number in the class database, along with your assigned
        distance. Enter the distances and the number of correct characters into
        MINITAB.</p>
      <h3>Regression of correct answers as a function of distance from the
        screen</h3>
      <p>1. Construct a "Scatter plot" for the data. Choose "<a href="scatterplot.jpg">Graph
          → Scatterplot</a>", then "<a href="scatterplot_options.jpg">With
          Regression</a>". Select the number of correct answers as the "Y" and
        distance as "X" (it should look like <a href="scatterplot_options1.jpg">this</a>).</p>
      <p>2. We're going to run the regression now, but MINITAB recently changed
        their regression function to be more flexible, but in the process they
        made it far more complicated than we need it to be. We can get what we
        need from the "Fitted line plot".</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open "Stat → Regression → <a href="fitted_line_plot1.jpg">Fitted
            line plot</a>". </li>
        <li>The number of correct characters is the response - assign it to the
          "Response (Y)" box. </li>
        <li>The distance from the screen is the predictor variable - assign it
          to the "Predictor" box.</li>
        <li>We will be doing a linear regression as the type of regression
          model.</li>
        <li> We need to check our assumptions graphically, so click on "Graphs"
          and click the "Four in one" button - we will look at the residual
          plots to determine if we meet the assumptions of regression. </li>
        <li>Click on "Storage" and check off "Standardized residuals". This will
          add a column to your data sheet called "SRES1" that shows how many
          standard deviations from the line each data point lies. In general,
          you expect 95% of the data values to fall within 2 s of the line, and
          99% to fall within 3 s of the line. We'll use these values to screen
          for unusual data points.</li>
        <li>Run the analysis. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>3. We should check for problems before we try to interpret the results
        of the regression.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Residual plots" src="residuals.jpg"><br>
              <br>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>First, look at the residual plots. They should look something
                like this (although not identical - these plots are from a
                previous year's data).</p>
              <p>The first plot (upper left) is a normal probability plot for
                the residuals (not the data values!), and we would like the
                points to follow the diagonal red line (they don't here,
                hopefully we had better luck this year). </p>
              <p>The next useful plot is the histogram (lower left), which we
                would like to be a bell shaped curve. If the probability plot
                doesn't look good, the histogram of residuals often helps figure
                out what the problem is - this histogram has a possible bimodal
                distribution, with a single outlier.</p>
              <p>Next, the residual vs. fitted plot (upper right) is useful to
                evaluating whether we meet the HOV assumption - we would like to
                see an equal amount of scatter vertically as you move from the
                left to the right of the graph. This graph has a small amount of
                scatter at high predicted correct characters, but more
                variability at low numbers of predicted correct characters.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">
              <p>The final graph (lower right) is more useful for tracking down
                which row of the data table contains outliers, and for scanning
                for possible data entry errors. Identifying outliers is
                important because they can both cause us to violate assumptions,
                and because they can strongly affect the results of our
                analysis. The big positive outlier we saw in the histogram is
                observation number 8, according to this graph.</p>
              <p>If the residual plots showed one or more points that were far
                away from the others. Look through SRES1 standardized residuals
                and see if you can find the points - they should have large
                values, either positive or negative, compared to the others
                (over 2). The outlier we saw in the residual plots has a
                standardized residual of 3.02, which means it is 3.02 standard
                deviations from its predicted value.</p>
              <p>The other thing we should look for is "influential" data
                points. When the regression line is fitted, it has to go through
                the mean of the predictor and the mean of the response (that is,
                point (<span style="text-decoration: overline">x</span>, <span
                  style="text-decoration: overline">y</span>)). The slope thus
                pivots around this point in order to place the line as close to
                the data points as possible.</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>

        <tbody>

            <td>
              <p>If you look at the example in the Graph A, there is a clear
                outlier, but it's only an outlier on Y. Since the outlier is
                close to the mean of X it wouldn't have much effect on the
                slope; it would be like putting a heavy weight in the middle of
                a teeter-totter. Since the point is far from the line it would
                have a big standardized residual, but it isn't influential
                because it doesn't affect the placement of the best-fit line. </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The next example (Graph B) shows an outlier in both the X and Y
        direction, and it is having a big effect on the line. Since the line is
        being dragged up close to the point it would not have a big standardized
        residual, but it is nevertheless an influential point because it is
        largely dictating the slope of the line. This isn't a good thing - we
        want the entire data set to dictate the slope, not just a single point,
        and if the outlier is also a mistake of some kind the entire analysis
        could be ruined by a single mistake. Look at the fitted line plot with
        the data and regression line, and see if we have any influential points
        that may be having a disproportionate effect on our results.</p>
      <p>4. Now that you know that the regression line is appropriate for the
        data (if in fact that's what we find) interpret the results. You will
        get results that look something like this (although possibly with
        different numbers...this is from a previous class): </p>
      <p><img src="regression_output.jpg" alt="Regression output">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      </p>
      <p>The output starts with the regression equation - the order of the terms
        is different than you're used to for a straight line equation; MINITAB
        gives the intercept first. The slope is the coefficient that is
        multiplied by the predictor variable, so -5.771 is the slope (don't
        forget the sign, very important!). Make sure your output shows correct
        characters on the left and distance on the right side of the equation -
        if they're reversed, you used distance as a response and correct
        characters as a predictor and you need to re-run the analysis.</p>
      <p>Next comes the "Model Summary" table. The first entry in the table is
        labeled "S", but we don't need to interpret S (it's the square root of
        the MS error).</p>
      <p>We do need to interpret the coefficient of determination, but we're
        given two different ones. The version called simply "R-sq" is the one we
        need - this is the proportion of variation explained by the line
        (expressed as a percent), and the closer to 100% it is the closer to the
        line the data points fall. The second one (R-Sq(adj)) is only useful
        when you have more than one predictor variable, so it's not of any
        interest to us.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Analysis of Variance table tests whether the regression is
        statistically significant. The "Regression" line is explained variation,
        "Error" is unexplained (or "residual") variation, and "Total" is the
        total variation in our data set.</p>
      <p>Based on this ANOVA table, the relationship between correct characters
        and distance was significant, but our class may get different results.</p>
      <p>There is no post-hoc procedure for a regression analysis, because there
        are no group means to compare.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> Challenge question 1. Ectothermic (or "cold-blooded") animals, such as
        insects, do not have the ability to metabolically burn energy to stay
        warm, and consequently often have body temperatures that match the
        temperature of their environments. At low temperatures insects usually
        become sluggish, and most flying insects are unable to burn energy
        rapidly enough to fly in the cold. Winter moths are exceptions, in that
        they are insects that are able to fly even when environmental
        temperature is near freezing. A scientist is interested in how winter
        moths manage to fly when environmental temperatures are cold, and
        develops three possible hypotheses: i) unlike other insects, winter
        moths can fly when their flight muscles are cold, ii) winter moths are
        the first known warm-blooded insect, or iii) winter moths generate heat
        in their flight muscles to allow them to fly when the air temperature is
        cold, but are otherwise cold-blooded.</p>
      <p>To test these hypotheses, she collects ten moths of approximately the
        same size, and places each in a chamber kept at a different temperature
        (30 degree to 75 degree F, at 5 degree increments) for 20 minutes. At
        the end of this period, she measures the temperature of each moth's
        thorax (which is where the flight muscles are found) and abdomen (which
        is not involved in flight, and should match the environmental
        temperature if the moth is a cold-blooded animal). Data from this
        experiment are <a href="challenge_q_lab11.MTW">here</a>. The first
        column gives environmental temperature, the second gives the temperature
        in the moth's thorax, and the last one gives temperature in the moth's
        abdomen.</p>
      <p>Note: You will need to run two different tests, the first looking for
        an effect of environmental temperature on abdominal temperature (to
        establish whether these moths are warm or cold blooded), and the second
        looking for an effect of environmental temperature on thorax temperature
        (to determine if they fly with their flight muscles warm or cold), and
        then use the results of both to address the researcher's question.</p>
      <p>Step I - does the abdominal temperature match environmental
        temperature?</p>
      <p>A. Statistically test whether <b>abdomen</b> temperature changes when
        environmental temperature is changed. What statistical procedure did you
        use? Give the test statistic, numerator and denominator degrees of
        freedom, and p-value.</p>
      <p>B. Interpret the result - does abdominal temperature change when
        environmental temperature changes?</p>
      <p>C. Give the regression equation for this analysis. What do the slope
        and constant each tell you?</p>
      <p>D. If the abdomen temperature was, on average, exactly equal to the
        environmental temperature, what should the slope and intercept of the
        regression equation be?</p>
      <p>Step II - do winter moths fly with cold flight muscles, or do they warm
        their thoraxes for flight? </p>
      <p>E. Statistically test whether <b>thorax</b> temperature changes when
        environmental temperature is changed. What statistical procedure did you
        use? Give the test statistic, numerator and denominator degrees of
        freedom, and p-value.</p>
      <p>F. Interpret the statistical result - does thorax temperature change
        when environmental temperature changes?</p>
      <p>G. Answer the scientist's question - do winter moths fly with cold
        flight muscles? Are they warm-blooded? Do they warm their thoraxes for
        flight? Explain how the statistical results led you to your conclusion.</p>
      <p>Challenge question 2.</p>
      <p>It may not be immediately obvious to you that regression and ANOVA are
        two different approaches to the same analysis, but in fact both are
        considered "linear models". To demonstrate this point, you have <a href="regression_anova.xls">some
          data</a> that represents a measure of gene expression for a gene that
        is thought to be important in immune responses in shrimp. One group of
        shrimp was given a virus and the other group are the controls. You can
        see that the "grouping variable" is expressed in two different ways, as
        words (column "Group") and as a numeric code (column "Group code") in
        which controls are coded 0 and virus infected individuals are coded 1.
        We are interested in testing whether gene expression is affected by the
        virus - how might we approach this analysis?</p>
      <p>1. ANOVA approach: Conduct a one-way ANOVA, with "Expression" as the
        response and "Group" as the factor.</p>
      <p>2. Regression approach: Conduct a linear regression analysis with
        "Expression" as the response and "Group code" as the predictor.</p>
      <p>3. Report the regression equation.</p>
      <p>4. Use the regression equation to predict expression when group code is
        equal to 0 (the controls).</p>
      <p>5. Use the regression equation to predict expression when group code is
        equal to 1 (the virus treated group).</p>
      <p>6. Compare the predicted values from 4 and 5 to the group means - they
        should be the same.</p>
      <p>7. Compare F and p values for your ANOVA and regression tables - they
        should be the same.</p>
      <p> 8. Based on 6 and 7, you should see that when only two groups are
        involved, regression and ANOVA are different versions of the same
        analysis. Explain how the regression analysis tested for differences
        between groups using this approach.</p>
