      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Today we will learn to test whether variables are normally distributed,
        and if they are how to calculate probabilities from a normal
        distribution to answer questions about our data. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="collect_data">Collect the data</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>To start, we will need to generate some data sets. Each of you will
        measure your head circumference, arm length and leg length, and then we
        will test whether these three variables are normally distributed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Record all of your data in millimeters, and record to the nearest 1 mm.
        To collect the data, do the following: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Measure the length of your right arm, from your armpit to the tip of
          your middle finger.</li>
        <li>Measure the outer length of your right thigh. Do this measurement
          seated, and measure from your hip joint to the end of your knee.</li>
        <li>Measure the circumference of your head.</li>
        <li>Report all three measurements in the class database.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the data are ready, I will post them to the class web site, and
        you can download the file and open it in MINITAB.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="prob_plots">Test for normality</h2>
      <p>1. In MINITAB, we can both get a very good graphical method of checking
        for normality and a quantitative test for normality at the same time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Graph" → "<a href="normal_plot_menu.jpg">Probability plot</a>"
          from the menu bar.</li>
        <li>Select "Single" as the probability plot type.</li>
        <li>In the box that pops up, put all three numeric variables into the
          "Graph variables" box.</li>
        <li>Click on "Multiple graphs", and in the "Multiple Variables" tab
          select "In separate panels of the same graph".</li>
        <li>Switch to the "By Variables" tab, and add "Sex" to the "By variables
          with groups on separate graphs" box (the lower one). Click "OK". You
          should end up with two probability plots, one for each sex.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the graphs to a Word file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>2. To check whether the variables are normal, check the P-Value for
        each of the three variables (in the legend on the right side of each
        graph). The rule is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the p-values are greater than 0.05, you "pass" the AD test, and
          you can treat your data as normally distributed.</li>
        <li>If the p-value is less than 0.05, you "fail" the AD test, and you
          shouldn't consider the data to be normally distributed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AD values are measures of "goodness of fit", and the poorer the fit of
        our data to the normal distribution the larger it will be. The p-value
        is the probability that a random sample of data from a normal
        distribution could have an AD value as big as ours. If the probability
        is large (i.e. p-value greater than 0.05), that means the data had a
        good chance of coming from a normal distribution, and we'll consider the
        data to be normal. If the probability is small (i.e. p-values less than
        0.05) then we'll conclude the data probably didn't come from a normal
        distribution.</p>
      <p>If you test for normality and you get a p-value less than 0.05 from the
        AD test, it means that you "failed" the AD test, and you shouldn't
        consider the data normal. This doesn't mean there is anything wrong with
        your data, it just means you shouldn't use the normal distribution as a
        way of trying to understand your data's distribution, because it's not a
        good model for your data.</p>
      <p>You can also look at the graphs, and as long as the red dots all fall
        within the two outer curved lines, you'll pass the AD test, and your
        data are close enough to normally distributed to treat them as normal
        data.</p>
      <p>3. Make histograms for each of these variables, with all three
        variables as panels of the same graph, but split by sex (use the
        "Multiple graphs" option, and group by sex as you did for your
        probability plots, above). Copy the histograms and paste them to your
        Word file.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="normal_probabilities">Normal probabilities</h2>
      <p>In humans, men are larger than women on average. Usually, when you
        compare the sizes of men and women for nearly any dimension, you find
        the sexes differ in average size, but that they overlap. We can think of
        probabilities as being numbers of times an event will occur out of a
        total number of trials, which means it's natural to think of
        probabilities as being equivalent to proportions. The probability that a
        woman has a longer arm than the average man is thus also an estimate of
        the proportion of women that should have longer arms than the average
        man.</p>
      <p>**WARNING** It isn't appropriate to calculate normal probabilities for
        variables that fail the AD test. The following instructions assume that
        arm length is normally distributed, but the instructions were written
        before the results were in and that may prove to be wrong. If we find
        that arm length is not normally distributed we may need to substitute
        one of the other variables. If arm length fails the normality test,
        check whether you need to use a different variable for this section
        before you proceed.</p>
      <p>MINITAB has a nice graphical platform for calculating these
        probabilities which helps you visualize what you are calculating. Before
        we can use it, though, we need to calculate the average and standard
        deviation of arm length for men and women. Recall that a normal curve is
        defined by a mean and a standard deviation, so once we have estimates
        for these parameters we'll have everything we need to calculate normal
        probabilities.</p>
      <p>1. Use the "Display descriptive statistics" command to calculate the
        mean and standard deviation of arm length for men and women in class.
        Record these on your assignment sheet.</p>
      <p>Now that you have the necessary parameter estimates, we are going to
        ask, what proportion of women have longer arms than the average man?</p>
      <p>2. First, let's graph the male and female distributions together so we
        can more easily see what we are calculating in the next steps. Select
        "Graph" → "<a href="normal_dist_plot.jpg">Probability distribution plot</a>".
        The type of plot to use for this graph is "Two Distributions". In the
        window that pops up, set both distributions to "Normal", and use the
        female mean and standard deviation of arm length for one, and the male
        mean and standard deviation for the other. Once you have the graph,
        right-click on it and select "Add" → "Reference Lines". In the form that
        pops up, add the male and female means (separated by a space) to the
        "Show reference lines at X values:" box. The graph will look something
        like <a href="normal_plots.jpg">this</a> when you're done. Copy and
        paste this graph to your Word file.</p>
      <p>3. Now we are going to calculate the probability that a woman will have
        an arm length greater than the men's mean. If you look at your graph,
        men have longer arms on average than women, so we are interested in a
        "right tail" probability for women, meaning we want to know the area
        under the women's curve, starting at the men's mean and extending to
        positive infinity. This is also called an "upper tail" probability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We can get this probability in MINITAB with a probability
          distribution plot, but this time select the "View Probability" type
          from the set of possible plot types.</li>
        <li>In the form that pops up, the "Distribution" tab allows you to
          specify the mean and standard deviation for the curve you will be
          using. We are calculating probabilities for the female data, so input
          the female mean and standard deviations here (make sure it's set to
          "Normal" distribution as well).</li>
        <li>Then, switch to the "Shaded Area" tab and check the "X Value" option
          for "Define Shaded Area By", which you should change to X Value.</li>
        <li>The shaded region options look like this:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="Shaded regions option" src="shaded_regions.png"><br>
          <br>
          Since we are interested in values above the men's mean, select the
          right tail option. This is illustrated as an X value, with the upper
          tail shaded above X. You would use this option any time you are
          calculating probabilities above a specified value, even if X was much
          further to the left, and most of the curve should be shaded.</li>
        <li>In the "X value" box, enter the male mean - this defines the value
          above which you will be calculating the probability. </li>
        <li>Click OK.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The graph that pops up will show the female curve, with the portion
        above the male mean shaded in red (the male curve won't be shown, as we
        only used the mean for the curve to specify the x-value). The
        probability is given above the shaded area. Copy and paste this graph to
        your Word file.</p>
      <p>4. Now, repeat this procedure, but modify it as needed to calculate the
        proportion of men that have shorter arms than the female mean.</p>
      <p>5. Try calculating the proportion of women that have arm lengths within
        1.5 s of the female mean. Select the correct shaded area, and specify
        the X Value for 1.5 s below and 1.5 s above the mean (you will need to
        calculate these values).</p>
      <p>That's it! Answer the questions on your assignment sheet.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge questions:</h2>
      <p>Normal probabilities: In a study of the prevalence of the human
        papillomavirus (HPV), doctors swabbed the skin of 100 patients, and
        measured the amount of HPV present in each sample. The data are <a href="normal_challenge_q.MTW">here</a>.</p>
      <p>1. Are these data normally distributed? What tools did you use to
        determine this?</p>
      <p>2. What is the mean and standard deviation of viral load?</p>
      <p>3. What's the probability of having less than or equal to 0 viral load
        in a sample?</p>
      <p>4. Is it possible to have a negative viral load? What does this tell
        you about whether your data really can be perfectly normally
        distributed?</p>
      <p>5. Within what range of viral loads would 95% of the people fall?</p>
      <p>6. Calculate a 95% confidence interval. How does it compare in size to
        the range you calculated in 5? What is different about a 95% CI and the
        range of viral loads that contains 95% of people?</p>
