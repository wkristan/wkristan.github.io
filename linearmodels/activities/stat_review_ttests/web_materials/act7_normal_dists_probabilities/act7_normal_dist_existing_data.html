      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Today we will learn to test whether variables are normally distributed,
        and if they are how to calculate probabilities from a normal
        distribution to answer questions about our data. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="collect_data">Open the data file</h2>
      <p>We will return to the data on body dimensions we used in Activity 2.
        Download <a href="body_dimensions.MTW">the file</a>, and open it in
        MINITAB.</p>
      <p>If you recall, the data are measures of biacromial diameter (i.e.
        distances from one shoulder to the other), age, sex, and body mass index
        (BMI) for 507 people. If we want to use the normal distribution to
        calculate probabilities for the numeric variables we first need to make
        sure that the normal distribution is a good fit.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="prob_plots">Test for normality</h2>
      <p>1. To start, let's see what the shapes of the distributions look like
        using a histogram.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start to make a histogram (you know how to do this - select the
          histogram option from the "Graph" menu), using the "Simple" option.</li>
        <li>Enter all three of the numeric variables into the "Graph variables",
          then click "Multiple Graphs..."</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the "Multiple Variables" tab, select "In separate panels of the
            same graph". This will put all three histograms in a single window.</li>
          <li>Click "OK", and then "OK" again to make the histogram</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll see that none of the variables looks very normal, but biacromial
        is showing some signs of being bimodal. This can happen when you are
        mixing together two different groups with different means. Individually
        they may be normally distributed, but the two different means form
        different modes when you combine them. To check for this, do your
        histogram again, but in the "Multiple Graphs" window, switch to the "By
        Variables" tab and enter "Sex" as "By variables with groups in separate
        graphs", like <a href="mult_graphs_by_sex.png">this</a>. When you click
        "OK" to make the graph this option will split the male and female data,
        and produce a different set of three histograms for each sex. Biacromial
        looks more bell shaped when you do this, and BMI for males looks better
        as well.</p>
      <p>Based on these histograms, we wouldn't expect the data to be normally
        distributed if we lumped men and women together, but at least biacromial
        might be if we separate them.</p>
      <p>Copy and paste the male and female histograms to Word.</p>
      <p>Now we can try a formal test of normality, which is reported as part of
        MINITAB's normal probability plot.</p>
      <p>2. In MINITAB, we can both get a very good graphical method of checking
        for normality and a quantitative test for normality at the same time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Graph" → "<a href="normal_plot_menu.jpg">Probability plot</a>"
          from the menu bar.</li>
        <li>Select "Single" as the probability plot type.</li>
        <li>In the box that pops up, put all three numeric variables into the
          "Graph variables" box.</li>
        <li>Click on "Multiple graphs", and in the "Multiple Variables" tab
          select "In separate panels of the same graph".</li>
        <li>Switch to the "By Variables" tab, and add "Sex" to the "By variables
          with groups on separate graphs" box (the lower one). Click "OK". You
          should end up with two sets of probability plots, one for each sex.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the graphs to a Word file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3. To check whether the variables are normal, check the P-Value for
        each of the three variables (in the legend on the right side of each
        graph). The rule is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the p-values are greater than 0.05, you "pass" the AD test, and
          you can treat your data as normally distributed.</li>
        <li>If the p-value is less than 0.05, you "fail" the AD test, and you
          shouldn't consider the data to be normally distributed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AD values are measures of "goodness of fit", and the poorer the fit of
        our data to the normal distribution the larger it will be. The p-value
        is the probability that a random sample of data from a normal
        distribution could have an AD value as big as ours. If the probability
        is large (i.e. p-value greater than 0.05), that means the data had a
        good chance of coming from a normal distribution, and we'll consider the
        data to be normal. If the probability is small (i.e. p-values less than
        0.05) then we'll conclude the data probably didn't come from a normal
        distribution.</p>
      <p>If you test for normality and you get a p-value less than 0.05 from the
        AD test, it means that you "failed" the AD test, and you shouldn't
        consider the data normal. This doesn't mean there is anything wrong with
        your data, it just means you shouldn't use the normal distribution as a
        way of trying to understand your data's distribution, because it's not a
        good model for your data.</p>
      <p>You can also look at the graphs, and as long as the red dots all fall
        within the two outer curved lines, you'll pass the AD test, and your
        data are close enough to normally distributed to treat them as normal
        data.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="normal_probabilities">Normal probabilities</h2>
      <p>Since biacromial diameter is the only variable that passed the AD test,
        we should only use the normal distribution as a model for biacromial
        diameter.</p>
      <p>In humans, men are larger than women on average. Usually, when you
        compare the sizes of men and women for nearly any dimension, you find
        the sexes differ in average size, but that they overlap. We can think of
        probabilities as being numbers of times an event will occur out of a
        total number of trials, which means it's natural to think of
        probabilities as being equivalent to proportions. The probability that a
        woman has a wider biacromial diameter than the average man is thus also
        an estimate of the proportion of women that have broader shoulders than
        the average man.</p>
      <p>MINITAB has a nice graphical platform for calculating these
        probabilities which helps you visualize what you are calculating. Before
        we can use it, though, we need to calculate the average and standard
        deviation of biacromial diameter for men and women. Recall that a normal
        curve is defined by a mean and a standard deviation, so once we have
        estimates for these parameters we'll have everything we need to
        calculate normal probabilities.</p>
      <p>1. Use the "Display descriptive statistics" command to calculate the
        mean and standard deviation of biacromial diameter for men and women in
        the data set. Record these on your assignment sheet.</p>
      <p>Now that you have the necessary parameter estimates, we are going to
        ask, what proportion of women have bigger biacromial diameters than the
        average man?</p>
      <p>2. First, let's graph the male and female distributions together so we
        can more easily see what we are calculating in the next steps. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Graph" → "<a href="normal_dist_plot.jpg">Probability
            distribution plot</a>". </li>
        <li>The type of plot to use for this graph is "Two Distributions". </li>
        <li>In the window that pops up, set both distributions to "Normal", and
          use the female mean and standard deviation of biacromial diameter for
          one, and the male mean and standard deviation for the other. </li>
        <li>Once you have the graph, right-click on it and select "Add" →
          "Reference Lines". In the form that pops up, add the male and female
          means (separated by a space) to the "Show reference lines at X
          values:" box. The graph will look like <a href="normal_plots_biacromial.png">this</a>
          when you're done. Copy and paste this graph to your Word file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3. Now we are going to calculate the probability that a woman will have
        a biacromial diameter greater than the men's mean. If you look at your
        graph, men have bigger biacromial diameters on average than women, so we
        are interested in a "right tail" probability for women - we want to know
        the area under the women's curve, starting at the men's mean and
        extending to positive infinity. This is also called an "upper tail"
        probability.</p>
      <p>To get this probability, we will use a probability distribution plot,
        but with a couple of different options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a probability distribution plot again, but this time select
          the "View Probability" type from the set of possible plot types.</li>
        <li>In the form that pops up, the "Distribution" tab allows you to
          specify the mean and standard deviation for the curve you will be
          using. We are calculating probabilities for the <strong>female</strong>
          data, so input the female mean and standard deviations here (make sure
          it's set to "Normal" distribution as well).</li>
        <li>Then, switch to the "Shaded Area" tab and check the "X Value" option
          for "Define Shaded Area By", which you should change to X Value.
          Select the right tail as the shaded region option, like this:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="Shaded regions option" src="shaded_regions.png"><br>
        </li>
        <li>In the "X value" box, enter the male mean - this defines the value
          above which you will be calculating the probability. </li>
        <li>Click OK.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The graph that pops up will show the same female curve as in your first
        plot, but now the portion of the female curve above the male mean will
        be shaded in red (the male curve won't be shown, as we only used male
        mean to specify the x-value). The probability is given above the shaded
        area. Copy and paste this graph to your Word file.</p>
      <p>4. Now, repeat this procedure, but modify it as needed to calculate the
        proportion of men that have smaller biacromial diameters than the female
        mean.</p>
      <p>5. Try calculating the proportion of women that have biacromial
        diameters within 1.5 s of the female mean. Select the correct shaded
        area, and specify the X Value for 1.5 s below and 1.5 s above the mean
        (you will need to calculate these values).</p>
      <p>That's it! Answer the questions on your assignment sheet.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge questions:</h2>
      <p>Normal probabilities: In a study of the prevalence of the human
        papillomavirus (HPV), doctors swabbed the skin of 100 patients, and
        measured the amount of HPV present in each sample. The data are <a href="normal_challenge_q.MTW">here</a>.</p>

        determine this?</p>
      <p>2. What is the mean and standard deviation of viral load?</p>
      <p>3. What's the probability of having less than or equal to 0 viral load

      <p>4. Is it possible to have a negative viral load? What does this tell
        you about whether your data really can be perfectly normally
        distributed?</p>
      <p>5. Within what range of viral loads would 95% of the people fall?</p>
      <p>6. Calculate a 95% confidence interval. How does it compare in size to
        the range you calculated in 5? What is different about a 95% CI and the
