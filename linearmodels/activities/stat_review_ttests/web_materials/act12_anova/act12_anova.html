              <p>For our exercise in analysis of variance, we are going to
                analyze data on European cuckoo egg sizes. European cuckoos are
                an unusual species of bird, in that they don't build their own
                nests. Instead, they lay eggs in the nests of other birds
                (called their "hosts"), who then incubate, hatch, and raise the
                cuckoo chicks as though they were their own offspring. The host
                species do this in spite of the fact that cuckoos are quite
                large, and often are able to monopolize all of the food, thereby
                starving the host bird's own offspring, and will at times even
                push the host species' chicks out of the nest.</p>
              <p>The data we will work with gives the sizes of <strong>cuckoo
                  eggs</strong> found in nests of various host species (Pied
                Wagtail, Wren, Meadow Pipit, Tree Pipit, Hedge Sparrow and
                Robin). These are all European birds, so you're unlikely to have
                ever seen them, but they vary in body size, with the robin being
                one of the larger species, and the wren being the smallest. The
                scientist who collected these data was interested in whether the
                cuckoo matched the size of her eggs to the size of the host
                species nest - if so, then there should be differences in cuckoo
                egg sizes between the host species nests, with the smallest eggs
                found in the wren nests.</p>

      <h2 class="part" id="data">Data analysis</h2>
      <p>For this exercise, we have some <a href="cuckoo_all_species.MTW">data</a>
        for <strong>cuckoo egg</strong> dimensions (length, breadth) from the
        nests of each of these hosts. Test whether egg sizes differ between host
        species, using MINITAB. In this file the data you want to compare are
        together in one column (they are stacked), and you need to tell MINITAB
        to use the "species" column to identify the groups (MINITAB calls
        grouping variables "factors").</p>
      <p>Do the following steps for each egg size variable (length and breadth,
        length used as an example below):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Test the homogeneity of variance assumption. We have to use a new
            test, called "Levene's test", because we have more than two groups
            now - it's accessed through "Stat → ANOVA → <a href="variance_test.png">Test
              for Equal Variances</a>...". Like all the other statistical tests
            we've done for assumptions, you will see a test statistic and a
            p-value, and if p &gt; 0.05 you passed the test.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Conduct a one-way ANOVA testing for differences in cuckoo egg
            length among host species. Select "Stat → <a href="oneway.png">One-Way...</a>",
            and then select length as the "Response" and species as the "<a href="oneway1.png">Factor</a>".
            <br> <br>
            Technically, you shouldn't conduct post-hocs until after you have a
            significant "omnibus" test from your ANOVA, but it will save time to
            ask for it now - click on "Comparisons" and check the box next to
            "Tukey". Also check the box to add "Tests" to the "Results". The
            "Error rate for comparisons" refers to the overall probability of a
            Type I error across all of the comparisons among pairs of species -
            we will leave that at the default value of 5.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You will get both graphical and text output describing the results.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Start with the text output</strong> - you will have an ANOVA
            table that looks like this (for egg length):<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="ANOVA" src="anova_table.png"><br>
            <br>
            The "species" source is the effect species on egg length. The
            "Error" source is the random, unexplained variation among individual
            eggs around the group means. Each source has a DF, sums of squares,
            and mean squares. The sums of squares and mean squares are called
            "adjusted", but don't worry about that here - it's relevant when you
            have a more complicated design than this, but doesn't concern us
            now.<br>
            <br>
            If the p-value shows a significant effect of species (if it's &lt;
            0.05), you can move on to the next section of text output.<br>
            <br>
            You will see a table of summary statistics for each group - sample
            sizes, means, standard deviations, and a 95% confidence interval.
            The intervals change depending on the sample size, but they all use
            the square root of the MSerror, rather than their own standard
            deviations, for the interval calculation.<br>
            <br>
            Below the table of means you will get Tukey results. This includes a
            grouping summary, with species that are not different sharing a
            letter - the original table of means was in alphabetical order, but
            this one is sorted by the mean, so that means that turn out not to
            be different from one another will be next to each other.<br>
            <br>
            Assuming you remembered to ask for "Tests", you will then see a
            table like this:<br>
            <br>
            <img alt="Tukey" src="tukey_table.png"><br>
            <strong></strong>Each row in the table is a test of a difference
            between means. The difference is listed first, then a standard error
            of the difference, followed by a 95% confidence interval. Next, a
            T-value is calculated as (difference/se), which is followed by a
            p-value - this is listed as an "Adjusted P-Value", because it is
            adjusted for the number of comparisons we are making. At the very
            bottom you'll see that the "Individual confidence level" is set at
            99.5% - this means that what MINITAB is labeling a 95% CI is
            actually a 99.5% CI - this more stringent level is also an
            adjustment for the number of comparisons we are making, and by
            having only a 0.5% chance of failing to include the true difference
            in each interval, overall we have a 5% chance of failing to include
            any of the differences in their intervals.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Now for the graphs</strong>:<br>
            <br>
            An "Interval plot of length vs. species" that shows the means for
            each group with 95% confidence intervals. <br>
            <br>
            A plot of "Tukey Simultaneous 95% CIs". These are confidence
            intervals for differences between pairs of means, so the means being
            compared are listed along the left axis, and the x-axis is in the
            data units. The difference between a pair of means is the center
            (the dot), and the interval width is adjusted to account for the
            fact that we need to make 15 comparisons between our 6 host species.
            If the interval includes 0, then a difference of 0 can't be
            rejected, and you would retain the null of no difference. If the
            interval doesn't include 0 then the difference is significant. This
            plot is where the summary table with letters identifying who is
            different from who comes from - </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once you have conducted the analysis for both variables, answer the
        questions on your handout. </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="challenge">Challenge Question</h2>
      <p> Following a wildfire in the chaparral vegetation of southern
        California, there are plants that grow in burned areas that are not seen
        during non-fire years. A scientist is interested in determining what it
        is about fire that causes these plants to grow. In the spring following
        a fire, when the plants have finished flowering and have produced seeds,
        she collects seeds from one of the plant species and takes them back to
        the lab. She divides the seeds into 40 sets of 200 seeds each. Each set
        is then randomly assigned to one of four treatments:</p>
      <p>1. Unmanipulated control</p>
      <p>2. Heated</p>
      <p>3. Ash</p>
      <p>4. Smoke</p>
      <p>Heated seeds are baked in a 450 degree oven for an hour, and are then
        planted in pots. Ash treated plants receive 10 ml of ash, generated by
        burning the wood of chemise shrubs (the most common chaparral plant).
        For the smoke treatment, she bubbles smoke from a burning chemise branch
        through water, so that the chemicals in the smoke are dissolved in the
        water, and then she uses the smoked water on the "smoke" group's pots -
        in this way she isolates the chemical effects of smoke from the heat
        that accompanies it in a fire. The unmanipulated controls are planted in
        pots, but receive no fire-related treatment. Aside from the treatments
        described, all of the pots are grown under identical conditions.</p>
      <p>At the end of three weeks, she counts the number of seeds that have
        germinated into seedlings. The data are in <a href="challenge_q_lab10.MTW">this
          file</a>.</p>
      <p>A. What kind of analysis will you run to test whether the treatments
        differ in average number of seedlings?</p>
      <p>B. Test for HOV, and report the result.</p>
      <p>C. Run the statistical procedure, and report the test statistic,
        numerator and denominator degrees of freedom, and p-value. Do you reject
        or retain Ho?</p>
      <p>D. Use a Tukey's procedure, and report which treatments are different
        from one another. Pay particular attention to whether the fire-related
        treatments (ash, heat, smoke)differ from the control.</p>
      <p>E. Answer the researcher's question - which of the fire-related
        treatments could explain why there's a flush of growth of this plant
        following a fire? What information told you this?</p>
