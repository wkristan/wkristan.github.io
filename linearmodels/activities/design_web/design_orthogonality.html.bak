      <p class="part" id="intro">Experiments are the most reliable method of
        testing for cause and effect relationships between variables. In an
        experiment we manipulate a predictor variable and observe the resulting
        change in a response variable. If there is no cause and effect
        relationship between the variables, then changing the predictor is
        expected to produce no change in the response.</p>
      <p class="part">If there is a change in the response variable, we need to
        know that the only thing that could have caused the change is the
        predictor variable, and it takes a well-designed experiment to give us
        this certainty. A good experiment should do two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It should enable us to detect real treatment effects, if they exist</li>
        <li>It should eliminate the possibility that we will conclude there is a
          cause and effect relationship between variables when there isn't one</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We know that errors in statistical testing (i.e. Type I and Type II
        errors) can interfere with these experimental goals. However, aside from
        Type I or Type II statistical errors, we should design experiments in a
        way that allows us to reach reliable conclusions about the presence or
        absence of cause and effect relationships.</p>
      <h2>Designing an experiment to test for a cost of parasitism</h2>
      <p>Today we will work with a simulation of an experiment that tests for an
        effect of parasites on metabolic rate in mice. Intestinal parasites
        potentially compete for food with the host, but some also eat host
        intestinal tissue. It's expected that carrying a parasite load will
        impose a metabolic demand on the host, because mice would likely have to
        increase their metabolic rate to repair the damage to their intestines.
        Mice can be experimentally infected with intestinal parasites by feeding
        them a known number of parasite eggs, and we will work with three
        different experimentally-induced infection levels (high, medium, or low)
        as our treatment variable. The response variable for the experiment is
        the metabolic rate of the mice, which is measured by the rate of oxygen
        consumed by the animals. </p>
      <p>As you learned in lecture, an "ideal" experiment would hold every
        variable constant except for parasite load. Certainly, every variable
        that affects metabolic rate should be held constant, but it may not be
        possible for everything to be exactly the same, and some variables that
        we think are not a problem might actually affect metabolic rate. For
        example, unless the mice are clones there will be genetic differences
        between individuals that may lead to variation in metabolic rate. If we
        don't have enough room in a single room to house all our mice we may
        have to split them between two or three rooms, and if there are
        differences in temperature, humidity, noise levels, or any number of
        possible environmental conditions, we might see some differences in
        metabolic rate due to those factors. We might suspect that things like
        age and sex may affect the weight of the animals, and weight definitely
        affects metabolic rate. Different strains of mice might differ in their
        energy needs as well. Holding these constant will give us nice clean
        results, but we might want to know if these characteristics of the mice
        actually do affect metabolic rate.</p>
      <p>If we can't hold a variable constant, we at least need to be sure it
        isn't confounded with the variable we're interested in - if we made the
        mistake of using only young animals for high parasite loads and only old
        animals for low loads we could end up with a difference between high and
        low that is actually due to age rather than parasite load. If we can't
        hold age constant, the options available to avoid confounding is to
        either randomize with respect to age or to block on age. Randomizing
        means to randomly select animals for each parasite treatment group, so
        that a more or less equal number of individuals of every age are
        randomly assigned. Randomizing prevents confounding most of the time,
        but it doesn't guarantee a lack of confounding - by chance you could
        still end up with enough animals of the same age in a group to produce a
        spurious result. We also don't typically account for variables that are
        randomized in our analysis. The primary benefit of random assignment is
        that it works for variables we don't know about, and thus don't know to
        hold constant or otherwise account for.</p>
      <p>The better option for variables like age, sex, or strain (i.e. white
        lab mice or wild mice) is to block on them. Blocking means to put an
        equal number of each animals from each treatment group into each age
        group. Doing this in your design guarantees that age can't be confounded
        with parasite treatment, because parasite and age are orthogonal in this
        design. Using a block design guarantees a lack of confounding even if
        you do not account for age in your analysis, but the real power of a
        block design is realized by including the blocked variable in your
        statistical analysis. Just like we statistically eliminated initial
        weight from an assessment of fat mass gain under different food intake
        levels, we can statistically eliminate age by including it in our GLM
        with parasite treatment.</p>
      <p>In short, the best way to deal with nuisance variables is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold them constant</li>
        <li>Randomize with respect to them</li>
        <li>Block on them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we block on a variable, but randomly select which individuals to
        assign to each combination of age and parasite treatment, we have used a
        <strong>randomized complete block</strong> design. Blocking prevents
        confounding for the variable we know could be an issue (i.e. age), and
        randomization helps us with variables we do not even know to worry
        about.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h2 class="part" id="effect_size">Effect size</h2>
        <p>Before we move on to our simulated experiment, we should discuss
          another important aspect of our use of statistics to guide our
          science: effect size. </p>
        <p>Effect size refers to the amount of difference in the response
          variable that is produced by the different treatment levels. A simple
          measure of effect size for a two-group experiment is&nbsp;the number
          of standard deviations between group means, which is known as "Cohen's
          d". To calculate it, you divide the amount of difference between two
          means by the pooled standard deviation:</p>
        <img src="cohen_d.png" alt="Effect size">
        <p style="clear:both">You can think of Cohen's d as a signal to noise
          ratio, where the signal is the amount of response to treatment
          (measured by the difference between group means), and the noise is
          unexplained random variation in the data (measured by the "pooled"
          standard deviation). In general we would expect that it would be
          easier to detect a strong signal with little noise in the
          transmission. For example, if you're making a phone call, the signal
          would be the words that the person you called is saying, and noise
          would be static in the transmission. The best case, of course, is to
          have a nice loud, clear transmission with little or no static
          interference. But, if the signal is weak (quiet, faint words) you
          might still hear it if there is little or no static in the
          transmission, but even a little static will obscure a weak signal. If
          the signal is strong (loud, clear words) then a small amount of static
          in the transmission won't prevent you from hearing what the person is
          saying, and the signal is only obscured when the static is severe.</p>

          <div style="float:left; width: 60%">
            <p>The app to the right illustrates how effect size works for a
              two-group experiment. By default both the difference between means
              and the standard deviation are set to 4, so the effect size is 1.
              Effect sizes of 1 or over are generally considered large effects,
              so you are looking at a large difference between the means from a
              statistical perspective. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>You can set the difference between means and the standard
              deviation to any values you want, and as long as they are set to
              the same number the effect size will be 1. Because of this you
              can't tell if an experimental treatment has been effective just by
              looking at the amount of difference between means - a difference
              between means or 4 or of 40 can represent the same effect size if
              the standard deviation is the same size as the difference between
              means. Since the pattern of distribution of the points doesn't
              change you may think the graph isn't changing, but watch the
              y-axis scale as you make changes to the app.</p>
            <p>Effect sizes of 0.5 are considered to be moderately large. To see
              what a moderate effect size looks like set the difference to a
              value that is 1/2 the size of the standard deviation - for
              example, set the difference in means at 4 and set the standard
              deviation to 8. Even though the amount of difference is the same
              as the default value of 4 the extra variability makes the data
              values overlap more between the groups, which makes the difference
              between the means appear smaller.</p>
            <p>To see a small effect set the difference to 4 and the standard
              deviation to 40 - this is a ratio of 0.1, which is considered a
              small effect size. The difference between means is the same as the
              large and moderate effect sizes you just looked at, but now with
              so much variability in the data the difference of 4 no longer
              looks very big at all.</p>
            <p>Given what you know about how statistical testing is done, which
              effect size has the greatest chance of giving us a statistically
              significant result?</p>

            <div style="display:none" id="eff_size_p">
              <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;"> Big effects are
                easier to detect statistically - as the difference in mean gets
                larger, the probability of obtaining a difference of that size
                goes down, and the p-value gets smaller.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="clear:both"> </p>
        <p>We can explore how effect size affects our ability to detect
          differences using a <strong>power curve</strong>, like the one below.
          Remember that statistical power is the probability of rejecting the
          null hypothesis when there is a real experimental treatment effect -
          that is, power is the probability of rejecting a false null
          hypothesis. The probability of making the mistake of <em>not</em>
          rejecting a false null hypothesis (otherwise known as a Type II
          statistical error) is called Î², and power is thus the probability of
          not committing this error, which is thus equal to 1-Î². Rejecting the
          null is how we statistically detect a treatment effect, so you can
          think of power as the probability of detecting a real treatment effect
          in an experiment.</p>
        <div style="float: left; width:60%">
          <p>The x-axis on the power curve is effect size, and you can see that
            power increases as the size of the effect increases, as expected -
            it's easy to detect a strong signal with little noise.</p>
          <p>What about small effects? With this sample size there is less than
            a 5% chance of detecting a small effect of 0.1. We consider a large
            effect to be 1 standard deviation between means, and there is only a
            55% chance of detecting an effect of this size with a sample size of
            10, and power doesn't get above 0.8 until there is 1.34 standard
            deviations between means.</p>
          <p>So, the first lesson is of the power curve is: <strong>small
              effects of a treatment may exist, but are very easy to miss.</strong></p>
          <p>But a sample size of 10 is not very large, and we would expect to
            have an easier time of detecting detecting small differences if our
            sample size increases. Double the sample size to 20 and see how the
            curve changes. You should see that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The power to detect a large effect of 1.0 is over 85%</li>
            <li>The power to detect a moderate effect of 0.5 is 33%</li>
            <li>The power to detect a small effect of 0.1 is still pretty low,
              at less than 5%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means that the second lesson is: <strong>increasing sample
              size is helpful, particularly for larger effect sizes, but small
              effects are still difficult to detect.</strong></p>
          <p>A good rule of thumb for adequate power is that you would like to
            have an 80% or better chance of detecting an effect of a size you
            are interested in, which is equivalent to a probability of 0.8 of
            rejecting a false null. If we want to be able to detect a small
            effect of 0.1 standard deviations between means, what would the
            sample size have to be? Go ahead and increase the sample size until
            an effect size of 0.1 is at or above 0.8. It's a big number, what
            did you get? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('eff_size_n')">Click

          <div style="display:none" id="eff_size_n">
            <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;">You'll see that it takes
              approximately a sample size of 1600 to detect a differecne of 0.1
              standard deviations between means</p>

        </div>
        <p style="clear:both">The third lesson is: <strong>it takes a massive
            amount of data to detect a small effect.</strong></p>
        <p style="clear:both">In addition to effect size and sample size, power
          is determined by the alpha level we use. Set the sample size back to
          10, and try changing the alpha level instead. If we increase the alpha
          level to 0.1 we would be able to detect smaller differences, because
          we would consider p-values up to 0.1 to be significant. The problem
          with this approach to increasing power is that it comes at the cost of
          increased false positive errors - remember that the alpha level is our
          Type I error rate when the null hypothesis is true, and because of
          this we usually don't change the alpha level as a way of increasing
          power. The best way to increase power to detect an effect of a given
          size is to collect more data. </p>
        <p>But, lesson three tells us that increasing sample size is not
          terribly practical when the effect sizes are small. We are much better
          off trying to work with large effect sizes, but how do we affect the
          size of an experimental treatment effect?</p>
        <h3>How do we affect effect size?</h3>
        <p>So far it appears that the only viable method of increasing power to
          detect an experimental treatment effect is to increase sample size,
          and this would be true if we were stuck with an effect size and had no
          ability to change it. But, in fact, there are design choices we can
          make that influence the effect size - if effect size is a signal to
          noise ratio, our choices for increasing this ratio are to either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <em><strong> Boost the signal</strong></em>: The size of
            response we can expect to get is set by the treatment levels - the
            bigger the dose of the treatment we use the bigger we can expect the
            difference between treatment and control to be. However, there are
            limits to how far you can push this - if you want your results to
            pertain to the real world you shouldn't use higher treatment levels
            than are likely to ever by found in nature. Additionally, the
            response to a treatment can change qualitatively if the dose is too
            high - the old saying that "the dose makes the poison" refers to the
            fact that even things that are good for us at low doses can become
            toxic at high doses. Increasing the treatment levels to the point
            that you over-dose and kill your subjects would not be a good idea.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Reduce the noise</strong></em>: In our analogy to a
            signal to noise ratio, the noise is the random variation in our
            data. This means that one of the ways we can increase the effect
            size is by reducing the amount of unaccounted-for random variation
            in the response. Some of the random variation in data is unavoidable
            - individual differences can't be completely eliminated. However, we
            should take pains both to avoid introducing random variation into
            our measurements in the course of doing the experiment, and to
            measure and account for any sources of variation that we don't
            otherwise eliminate. In a linear model, the noise is residual
            variation, so we want to make the residual SS and residual MS as
            small as possible. We can (and should) reduce the noise in several
            ways.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>We should be careful in our measurements, because sloppiness
              adds to the random variation in our data.</li>
            <li>We should hold as many factors constant as possible to avoid
              adding unmeasured, uncontrolled variation to the data.</li>
            <li>We should block on factors that we can't (or don't want to) hold
              constant, and account for the blocks statistically in our
              analysis.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Notice the return of holding nuisance variables constant or blocking
          on them in this list - we were introduced to these as methods of
          avoiding spurious results from confounded variables, but they are also
          methods of minimizing random variation in the data that increase
          treatment effect sizes, and thus increase our statistical power. Note
          that randomly assigning subjects to treatment groups is not here in
          this list - it is essential for preventing confounding from variables
          we don't know about, or can't hold constant, but it does not eliminate
          statistical noise.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For today's exercise will look at how holding variables constant,
        randomizing them, or blocking on them affects our ability to detect
        treatment effects.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="exercise">Today's exercise</h2>
      <p>We will be simulating an experiment that tests for a metabolic cost of
        parasitism. Parasite treatment is the only variable of scientific
        interest in this study, and will be included for you in every design,
        with the same number of mice in each treatment group. Because this is a
        simulation, I can tell you that the parasite groups do have a
        population-level difference in mean metabolic rate - high parasite
        treatment is 2 units above medium, and medium is 2 units above low.
        Because we know this to be the case, we also know that any time you do
        not get a statistically significant test of the effect of parasite you
        have experienced a Type II statistical error (failing to detect a real
        difference). The rate at which you do reject the null hypothesis for
        parasite is thus your statistical power to detect the effect - if 1 out
        of 50 repetitions of an experiment produce a statistically significant
        effect of treatment then power is 1/50 = 0.02, or a 2% chance of
        detecting the effect. If 49 out of 50 repetitions produce a
        statistically significant effect of treatment then power is 98%. We want
        power to be as high as possible.</p>
      <p>You do not have the ability to change the overall sample size, or to
        change the experimental treatment (can't add or drop parasite treatment
        levels, or change the number of parasite eggs given for each level).
        However, there are a variety of nuisance variables that you need to
        decide how to contend with: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strain - you have access to white mice, and to a strain of wild
          house mouse.</li>
        <li>Sex - male or female.</li>
        <li>Age - the mice are bred in captivity, and are of known age. You have
          access to juveniles and adults.</li>
        <li>Observer - these experiments are labor intensive and time consuming,
          and you're too busy being an internationally famous scientist to do
          the experiment yourself. You have three different helpers (Fred, Mary,
          and Jane) available to collect data.</li>
        <li>Chamber - three different climate-controlled chambers are available
          for housing the mice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have written a web-based app that will do the experiments for you, <a
          target="_blank" href="simulation/design_simulation.html">which you can
          access here</a>. Clicking on the link will open the app in a separate
        window, so you can work with it while you read the instructions.</p>
      <p>You will see that on the left side of the app in a light gray box are
        the nuisance variables that you have to work with. You have three
        different ways of dealing with nuisances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Randomize them - checking <strong>no boxes</strong> for a nuisance
          factor causes it to be randomized. Subjects are selected randomly with
          respect to that variable. The levels selected will show up in the data
          table so you can see that they were randomized, but they are not used
          in the ANOVA.</li>
        <li>Hold them constant - checking a <strong>single box</strong> causes
          all of the mice selected to be of that kind (checking "White" for the
          strain causes only white mice to be used, for example).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Block on them - checking <strong>two or more boxes</strong> causes
          each selected level to be included, and all possible combinations of
          blocks and treatment levels will be included in the analysis. Note
          that subjects are randomly assigned to the combinations to deal with
          variables we don't know about, but equal numbers of subjects are
          placed in each combination of levels for the blocking factor so that
          they will be orthogonal. Blocking on a variable causes it to be
          included in the ANOVA, and variation explained by the variable is
          assigned to its row in the table, instead of remaining as unexplained
          variation in the Residual SS.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that random assignment of individuals to treatment groups is
        always done, even for variables that are blocked or held constant - if
        you are using white, adult, female mice then randomly selecting from
        among the available white, adult, female mice to assign to each parasite
        treatment group is a good idea.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>The designs:</h3>
      <p>To see how the design choices you make affect the experimental results
        you obtain, you will compare several different experimental designs. The
        app will always include the treatment variable (parasite level) as a
        predictor, and metabolic rate is always the response variable. The
        designs will differ in how you treat the nuisance variables.</p>
      <h4>All nuisances randomized</h4>
      <p>1. Run an experiment in which none of the nuisance levels are checked -
        this is how the experiment is set up initially, with no check boxes
        checked. When you click the "Run experiment" button you'll see that the
        data set always has an even number of High, Medium, and Low parasite
        treatments, but the levels for observer, strain, sex, chamber, and age
        are all assigned at random. Pay attention to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graph: how much scatter is there in the metabolic rates (vertical
          scatter in the red dots for each group)? How much variation is there
          in the means? How big are the confidence interval bars?</li>
        <li>ANOVA table: make note of</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Total SS - this is a measure of the total amount of variation in
            the metabolic rate data. With so many variables being allowed to
            vary at random this will be large.</li>
          <li>Treatment SS - this is a measure of the variation in metabolic
            rate that is accounted for by differences in parasite treatment. It
            will be a small fraction of the total.</li>
          <li>Residual SS - this is the measure of unexplained, random variation
            in the data. It is due both to the truly unpredictable variation in
            metabolic rate, and to the variation due to all of the nuisance
            variables we know about, but have chosen to allow to vary at random.
            When we don't include a predictor in a model all of the variation in
            the response that it's responsible for goes into the residual SS.</li>
          <li>F ratio and p-value - the F ratio is the MS<sub>treatment</sub>/MS<sub>residual</sub>,
            and will be big if the amount of explained variation is big compared
            to the amount of unexplained, random variation. If F if big enough p
            will be less than 0.05 (the cell with the p-value will turn red if
            it is less than 0.05).</li>
          <li>Partial Î·<sup>2</sup> (eta squared) - this is a measure of effect
            size that is appropriate for ANOVA designs with more than two groups
            (the d statistic is problematic with more than two groups). It
            measures the proportion of the treatment + residual SS that is
            accounted for by the treatment. It's equal to r<sup>2</sup> when
            there is only one predictor, because Total SS = Treatment SS +
            Residual SS, and r<sup>2</sup> is Treatment SS / Total SS, but when
            there is more than one predictor it is not equal to the multiple R<sup>2</sup>.
            An Î·<sup>2</sup> of 0.02 is considered small, of 0.13 is moderate,
            and 0.26 or larger is considered large. Note whether the effect size
            is small, moderate, or large for this design. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Randomizing is expected to avoid confounding between the nuisance
        variables and the parasite treatment variable, but it doesn't reduce the
        amount of random, unexplained variation in the data. Since this design
        leaves the greatest possible amount of unexplained, random variation in
        the data it should have the lowest statistical power - the p-value may
        not be significant in this initial run.</p>
      <p>2. Click "Run experiment" to repeat the experiment 50 times. Each time
        you run it, note any major changes you see in the appearance of the
        graph (for example, are the means always in the order small, medium,
        large, or do they change order sometimes?). Also watch for big changes
        in the ANOVA table, and any tendency for the effect size measure to
        change by large amounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Record</strong> how many of your 50 runs had p-values less than
        0.05 (remember, this number divided by 50 is your statistical power).</p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>All nuisances constant - the Experimental Ideal</h4>
      <p>1. Next use a design in which you hold all of the nuisance variables
        constant (you can pick which levels to check, but only check one level
        per nuisance variable). </p>
      <p>Clicking "Run experiment" you will get a data set with columns for each
        nuisance showing the level you selected, a column for the treatment
        groups, and one for metabolic rate. All three of the treatment levels
        are still being used, but only the levels you checked show up in the
        data set for all of the nuisance variables. The ANOVA table will still
        only have Treatment as a variable - we need at least two different
        levels to include a predictor in our analysis, so none of the predictors
        are included in the model.</p>
      <p>Holding all the nuisance variables constant should produce the most
        consistent data with the smallest amount of variation. Note the
        following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graph: the data values should be much less variable, because you are
          only using a single strain, sex, age, chamber, and observer.
          Differences in metabolic rate between strains, sexes, ages, chambers,
          and observers is simply eliminated from the data set, resulting in a
          much more consistent set of measurements. The confidence intervals
          around the means should also be much less, because the smaller amount
          of individual variation in the data leads to a residual MS, which is
          used as the measure of variance for the confidence intervals. Smaller
          residual MS leads to smaller confidence intervals.</li>
        <li>ANOVA table: you should see that -</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Total SS should be much smaller, since the data are less
            variable. </li>
          <li>The treatment SS should be roughly the same size as before, since
            the treatment effect is unchanged</li>
          <li>The Residual SS should be much smaller - without the contribution
            of our nuisance variables only the truly unpredictable random
            variation among individuals is left in the residual term, and it
            should thus be smaller</li>
          <li>The F ratio should be bigger, and the p-value should be less than
            0.05 most of the time. With a smaller residual SS the residual MS
            will be smaller, which will make F bigger and p smaller</li>
          <li>The effect size (partial&nbsp; Î·<sup>2</sup>) should be larger,
            because the treatment SS will be a much larger fraction of the total
            variation now that most of the random variation has been eliminated.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>2. Repeat the experiment 50 times, and make note of the same things
        that you did for step 2 of your "everything randomized" model. Record
        the number of runs that were statistically significant. Since this
        design allows for the least amount of random variation, and has the
        largest possible residual degrees of freedom, this design should give
        you the highest power.</p>
      <p>3. Change which level you're holding constant for each of the nuisances
        one at a time and see what happens to the graph. Make note of whether
        the order of the means stays the same (Low &lt; Medium &lt; High) as you
        change the levels you use.</p>
      <h4>Blocked on everything possible</h4>
      <p>1. With 16 mice per group, with 3 treatment groups, you have 48 mice in
        the experiment. There are 3 treatments, 2 strains, 2 sexes, 2 ages, 3
        chambers, and 3 observers, for 3x2x2x2x3x3 = 216 possible combinations
        of all the levels of every variable. You have to include the 3 treatment
        groups, so you can at most block four of the five nuisances with 2
        levels each (that is, 3x2x2x2x2 = 48).</p>
      <p>Make this design by checking both boxes for strain, sex, and age,
        checking two of the chambers, and only one of the observers (observer
        will be held constant). The data set will show each of the blocked
        factors appearing in all possible combinations, with a single row for
        each combination of the variables.</p>
      <p>Make note of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graph: because we are allowing mice of both strains, both sexes,
          both ages, and two of the three chambers into the experiment, the
          variability in the data is big again. However, we are accounting for
          the variation added by these four nuisance variables, so the
          confidence intervals on the means is still small.</li>
        <li>ANOVA table: you should see that -</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Each of the nuisance variables we blocked is included in the
            table.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;Total SS - should be similar to the design in which all of
            these variables were allowed to vary at random, because we are again
            allowing most of the nuisance variables to contribute to variation
            in metabolic rate.</li>
          <li>Treatment SS - should be very similar to the other models. The
            nuisance variables are blocked, which means they are independent of
            the Treatment effect, and we should get fairly consistent measures
            of variation explained by Treatment.</li>
          <li>SS for each of the blocks - we now have a line for each of the
            blocked factors. To the extent that a block effect causes variation
            in metabolic rate the SS will be greater than 0, and some may be
            bigger than the treatment SS (we might expect differences in
            metabolic rate for different strains, sexes, and ages of mice that
            could be as big an effect, or possibly bigger effects, than the
            parasite treatment effect).</li>
          <li>Residual SS - should be as small as for the model in which all of
            the nuisance variables were held constant.</li>
          <li>F and p - should be similar to the model in which all nuisances
            were held constant, because the residual SS is low.</li>
          <li>Effect size (partial Î·<sup>2</sup>) should be approximately the
            same size as the hold everything constant model, because the
            residual SS is small, and the treatment SS should be unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that not all block effects will always be significant. The degrees
        of freedom for each block effect is taken out of the residual df, which
        reduces power (MS<sub>residual</sub> is SS<sub>residual</sub>/df<sub>residual</sub>,
        so making df<sub>residual</sub> smaller increases the size of the MS<sub>residual</sub>).
        Including a block effect with a small SS will not justify this loss of
        df<sub>residual</sub>, and may not justify inclusion in the model.</p>
      <p>2. Repeat the experiment 50 times, and make note of the same things
        that you did for step 2 of your "everything randomized" model. There
        will be more variation in the data than you got by holding everything
        constant, but variation due to the factors you blocked on is being
        accounted for. Power should be close to what you got by holding
        everything constant - you lose some residual degrees of freedom by
        including your blocks in your analysis, but to the extent that the
        blocks really do affect the response it helps to account for them.</p>
      <h4>Your choice - combination of holding variables constant, randomizing,
        and blocking</h4>
      <p>1. This time design an experiment to try to make the residual SS and
        residual MS as small as possible. You are required to use at least two
        observers (it's too much work to do the experiment yourself) and need to
        use at least two growth chambers (not enough room in one), but aside
        from those constraints you can try any combination of holding variables
        constant, randomizing, and blocking until you get a model that gives you
        the smallest possible residual SS.</p>
      <p>In general, it helps you to include a block if the blocks actually have
        different means - if they don't, then including them doesn't explain
        much of the variation in the data, and reduces residual degrees of
        freedom, which can reduce your power.</p>
      <p>2. Repeat the experiment 50 times, and record the same observations as
        you did for the other designs.</p>
      <h3>The report</h3>
      <p>To summarize what you've learned, write a short report (1-2 pages) that
        explains how the different designs performed. For the all constant vs.
        all random designs, explain why you got better results by holding all of
        the nuisance variable constant. What happens to the effect size for
        parasite (as indicated by partial Î·<sup>2</sup>) when you allow
        everything to vary at random, compared to when you hold everything
        constant (and why? Since the amount of difference between the parasite
        groups is always the same at the population level, what can cause effect
        size to change)? What happens to the variation added by randomly
        selecting strains, sexes, ages, observers, and chambers (i.e. where do
        the SS added to the data from these factors go)? Explain why blocking on
        everything you could gave you results that were like the hold constant
        model, even though the total SS was large like the everything random
        model.</p>
      <p> For your own design, tell me how well it worked. Be sure to address
        the following: </p>
      <p>- How did you deal with each source of nuisance variation? Which ones
        did you hold constant, which did you randomly allocate to treatment
        levels, and which did you measure and account for statistically?</p>
      <p>- How often did you detect a parasite effect, compared with the other
        three designs?</p>
      <p>- Why might you want to block on a factor instead of holding it
        constant (for example, do you learn anything from a significant block
        effect)? Which of the factors you blocked on were consistently
        significant?</p>
      <p>- You should have noticed that effect size was highly variable when you
        allowed all of the nuisance variables to vary at random. When you held
        all of the nuisances constant, or blocked on four of the five of them,
        the effect sizes were much more consistent. What does this tell you
        about what we can know about effect size from our data? How consistent
        were the estimates of effect size for your own design?</p>
      <p>- Calculate the power for each of the designs you reported on here
        (number of times you get a significant effect of parasite divided by
        50). Which design had the greatest power?</p>
      <p>When you are done, upload your report to the course web site. Due in
        one week, 10/16 at the beginning of class.</p>
