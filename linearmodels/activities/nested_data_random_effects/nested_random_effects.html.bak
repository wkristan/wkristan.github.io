      <p class="part" id="intro"> We will be working with two different topics
        today, nested factors and random effects. Nesting has to do with the the
        arrangement of treatment levels relative to each other. Random effects
        have to do with whether a predictor variable has been experimentally set
        (with levels that would be used again if the experiment was repeated),
        or has been sampled from a larger population (with levels that would
        change if the experiment were repeated). Don't lose sight of the fact
        that these are two different concepts, but we tend to talk about them
        together because nested factors are frequently also random effects.</p>
      <p> All of the data you will use today are in <a href="nested_random_effects.xls">this</a>
        file. Download it to your computer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="nested">Nested factors in a fixed effects analysis:</h2>
      <p> The first data set we will use gives gestation lengths among several
        different genera of mammals. We are interested in differences among
        these particular genera, and thus we will treat them as fixed effects.
        However, we know that genera are nested within families, and families
        are nested within orders, and this organization of the data leads to a
        lack of independence of the species included in each genus. We will test
        whether genera differ from one another, given this hierarchical nesting
        of the taxonomic levels.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 1. Start a new project in a folder called "random_effects", and start
        a new R script for your commands. Import the sheet "mammals" from your
        Excel file into R Studio. Call the data set "mammals".</p>
      <p>2. Gestation length is highly right skewed - we know that we can log
        transform a response variable on the fly in our model statement, but we
        can also log transform a column and add it as a new variable to our data
        set. To log transform gestation length, use the command:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">mammals$ln.gestation &lt;- log(mammals$gestation)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. Fit a linear model with ln.gestation as the dependent variable, and
        with order, family, and Genus as predictors. To let R know that Genus is
        nested within family, and family within order, the model should look
        like this:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"><span class="R-code">lm(ln.gestation ~ order/family/Genus,
          data = mammals) -&gt; mamm.gest.lm<br>
        </span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 4. Generate an ANOVA table for the model. Because of the hierarchical
        nature of the factors, it makes sense to generate a sequential table
        (Type I), so use the anova() command, not the Anova() command. The final
        level is the unexplained variance (i.e. the error term), so the order
        that the variables are entered will give you the effects of taxonomic
        Order first, then Family once Order is accounted for, then Genus once
        order and family are accounted for.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 5. It's conceivable that the effects of taxonomic group on gestation
        lengths are attributable to body size. Larger animals are expected to
        take longer to gestate than smaller ones, and some taxa (e.g.
        carnivores) are larger than others (e.g. rodents). You can incorporate
        this possibility into your analysis by including body mass as a
        predictor in the model. Body mass is also strongly non-normal, so
        log-transform the variable, and call it ln.mass.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Fit a model that explains log gestation with log mass plus the nested
        effects of order/family/Genus, and call the model "mamm.gest.mass.lm".
        From this analysis you can see that it's possible to mix nested and
        non-nested variables in a model. Compare the ANOVA tables and see how
        accounting for mass changed the sums of squares accounted for by each
        taxonomic level.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="random">Random effects models</h2>
      <p> R has a variety of tools for working with random effects models, but
        we will just be scratching the surface on linear mixed models today. As
        such we will stick to the relatively limited built-in mixed models
        support in the aov() command. More complicated, but much more capable,
        add-on packages are available, and if you want to learn more about
        random-effects modeling in R, the best available package is called
        "lme4". Linear mixed-effects modeling is the new Big Deal in ecological
        and evolutionary biological data analysis, but it is a complex, advanced
        topic that's beyond the scope of this class.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> We will work with versions of the pig sires and dams data we saw in
        lecture. To get started, we will work with a two-way factorial ANOVA in
        which both sire and dam are considered random effects. Consequently,
        rather than considering the purpose of the analysis to be identification
        of the best boar for breeding purposes, we are interested in whether it
        is paternal effects or maternal effects that have the greatest influence
        on piglet weight gain. The data represent an experiment in which five
        different male pigs (sires A-E) are mated with one of two females (dams
        A or B). The weight gained by their piglets after a period of several
        weeks is measured (wgain). This is a modified version of the actual data
        set, and bear in mind it isn't very realistic to expect to do an
        experiment in which a single female bears piglets from five different
        males (and even if it's possible, the order in which they were mated to
        each male would become an issue, as sow age and maternal experience
        would become important). To keep the example simple, though, we will
        ignore this complication so that we can see how the models compare.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 1. Import data from the sheet "pigs_rand_crossed" into a data set
        called "pigs.rand.crossed".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 2. To fit your first model, with both sire and dam treated as random
        effects, type the command:</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd"> aov(wgain~sire*dam + Error(sire*dam),
          data=pigs.rand.crossed) -&gt; prc.aov</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The aov function is a linear modeling function, but it is specialized
        for analysis of variance designs. It has the ability to use random
        effects by specifying factors which are considered sources of random
        error (or "error strata"). In this case, because we are treating both
        sire and dam as random effects, as well as the interaction between them,
        we are using "Error(sire*dam)" to identify all of the terms in the model
        as random effects.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 3. Generate the ANOVA table. Type the command:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd"> summary(prc.aov)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> and submit it. You will see that the output gives several lines, each
        labeled as "Error" (as in "error term", not "you blew it sucker"). There
        is an error term for sire ("Error: sire"), one for dam ("Error: dam"),
        and one for the interaction between them ("Error: sire*dam"), as well as
        the usual error term for variation among individual data points (called
        "Error: Within").</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Unlike MINITAB, the package used by your book, R does not produce F
        tests for random effects. This appears to be due to differences of
        opinion among statisticians over whether significance tests are
        appropriate for random effects (R programmers take the position that
        estimates of variance components are fine, but not significance tests).
        Taking your book's authors' side on this one, we will need to compute
        the random effects p-values by hand. The easiest way to get F and
        p-values from the information provided by R is to calculate them in
        Excel, but first we have to get the output into an Excel spreadsheet.
        So...</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 4. Copy the output into an Excel spreadsheet. Select the output in R
        Commander, and paste it into Excel.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> At first each row of output will appear in a single cell in column A,
        <a href="excel1.png">like so</a>. We need to split these blocks of
        output into different cells. To do that, select all fifteen rows of
        output (A1 to A15), switch to the Data tab, and click on the "Test to
        columns" item (about the middle of the tab). The wizard that starts up
        will split the columns based on their positions, or based on characters
        that separate the numbers and labels ("delimiters") - since our data are
        separated by spaces, we will treat it as delimited text, so click
        "Next". In the next window, use "Space" as the delimiter, and click
        "Next". In the final window, accept all the default formatting by
        clicking "Finish".&nbsp; The result should look like <a href="excel2.png">this</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The numbers are now in separate cells, which is good, but we need to
        re-arrange things to look like an ANOVA table. To do that, you can do
        the following:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> - Delete the first row (with Error: dam).</p>
      <p> - Make sure the columns are labeled correctly. The first column of
        numbers are degrees of freedom (Df), the second column are sums of
        squares (SS), the third are mean squares (MS). The next column will be
        the F values we calculate, and the final column will be the p-values.</p>
      <p> - Delete the rows separating the sire:dam term from the Residuals
        term. The final table should look like this:</p>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 542px; height: 136px;" alt="Table" src="rand_effects1.png"><br>
      <p> 5. Once the values are in a table, calculate the F values. Remember
        that in a random effects model, a random main effect has variability due
        to the main effect, the interaction, and the error term. The interaction
        term has variability due to the interaction and the error term, so the
        only difference between the main effect and the interaction term is the
        main effect itself; consequently, the interaction MS is the appropriate
        denominator for the test of main effects in this model. Assuming your
        table looks like the one above, to get the F for the effect of sire,
        select cell E2, and type in the spreadsheet equation:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =D2/D4</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> which gives you the ratio of the sire MS and the sire:dam MS. The F
        for the effect of dam goes into E3, and will be equal to:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =D3/D4</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> And, the F for the interaction is the interaction MS over the error
        MS. It will go into E4, and will be equal to:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =D4/D5</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> To get p-values for these F values, we will use Excel's "FDIST"
        function. The function takes an f-value as its first input, and the
        numerator and denominator degrees of freedom as its second and third
        inputs. To get the p-value for the sire main effect, click into cell F2
        and type the function:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =FDIST(E2,B2,B4)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> which uses the F-ratio for the sire main effect (E2), the degrees of
        freedom for the sire main effect (B2), and the degrees of freedom for
        the sire:dam interaction (B4), and returns the p-value for the sire
        random effect. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The p-value for the dam random effect would be:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =FDIST(E3,B3,B4)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The interaction p-value would be:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="Excel"> =FDIST(E4,B4,B5)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="mixed">Mixed fixed and random effects model, with one
        nested factor.</h2>
      <p> The actual pigs data set is different from the one we just analyzed.
        Sires are considered fixed effects, because we're interested in the the
        particular sires (the farmers want to identify the best ones for
        breeding purposes, so sires are not simply random picks from a
        population of possible sires). Because a single sire can inseminate many
        sows, and not just the ones used in this study, dam is considered a
        random effect. Furthermore, a single dam can only be used with each sire
        once, which means that dam is nested within sire. Two piglets from each
        dam's litter are randomly selected to measure growth, and there are thus
        two measures of growth per dam.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 1. Import the data in sheet "pigs" into a data set called "pigs".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 2. Fit a model with sires as the main effect, and with dams as the
        random effect. This will cause the effect of sires to be tested against
        the dam within sires MS.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="R-code"> aov(growth ~ sire + Error(dam), data = pigs)
          -&gt; pigs.mixed.lm</span></p>
      <p><span class="R-code"> summary(pigs.mixed.lm)</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> 3.&nbsp; Because sire is a fixed effect, you will get a p-value for it
        in the ANOVA table. You'll see that the MS for this effect is 1.0031,
        which is equal to the sire MS over the dam MS. The dam MS is listed in
        the "Residuals" line of the "Error: dam" block of output. To get the
        p-value for the random effect of dam, you can use Excel to calculate an
        F-value (dam MS/error MS), and then a p-value (using 5 degrees of
        freedom for the numerator and 10 for the denominator).</p>
