  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The purpose of this data set was 
	to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian 
	species to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa 
	and different body size groups. Data were collected from the literature, and 
	data sources are documented for each species within the data file. Since life 
	history characteristics will show minor variation with environmental conditions 
	(resource availability, climate, competitive environment, and predation pressure) 
	a general life history for each species was sought to average over minor differences 
	in local populations. To create a general life history for each species, life 
	history values are often an average from several literature sources. Life 
	history variables included in the data set are: Maximum Lifespan (months), 
	Age of First Reproduction (months), Gestation time (months), Weaning age (months), 
	Weaning Mass (grams), Litter size (months), litters per year, newborn mass 
	(grams), and adult body mass (grams). Since these data were collected with 
	the intent to examine general life history patterns, these data are good for 
	examining large-scale patterns, specifically in comparing life history characteristics 
	for different orders or families of mammals. All orders of placental mammals, 
	except Chiroptera (bats) are represented in this data set: Artiodactyla (161 
	species), Carnivora (197), Cetacea (55 species), Dermoptera (2 species), Hydracoidea 
	(4 species), Insectivora (91 species), Lagomorpha (42 species), Macroscelidea 
	(10 species), Perissodactyla (15 species), Pholidota (7 species), Primates 
	(156 species), Proboscidea (2 species), Rodentia (665 species), Scandentia 
	(7 species), Sirenia (5 species), Tubulidentata (1 species), and Xenarthra 
	(20 species). There are two caveats on this data set, however. First, these 
	data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration 
	of life history parameters with specific environmental conditions is important. 
	Second, while this data set is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The creation 
	of an exhaustive data set is the ultimate goal, but that goal is still several 
	years from completion. In the meantime, researchers utilizing the data set 
	are urged to conduct their own search for data not reported within the current 
	data set. Researchers are also encouraged to contact the author of the data 
	set and alert her to literature sources containing data for missing variables 
	or species. The updated data set will be made available to <i>Ecological Archives</i> 
	periodically. </font></p>
