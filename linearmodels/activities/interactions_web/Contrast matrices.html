      <h1>Setting up contrast matrices for glht</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <p>The glht() command can accept user-specified contrasts, which means we
        can make any comparison between means that we want, and glht() will do
        the appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons for us.</p>
      <p>However, glht() wants us to specify the contrasts we want in the form
        of a matrix. The matrix we will supply will be a matrix that produces
        the comparisons between groups we are interested in, which is the
        product of a contrast matrix and a design matrix.</p>
      <p>The design matrix is just a matrix that represents how we would predict
        the mean for each combination of factor levels in our model. For
        example, if we are working with the model:</p>
      <p>height ~ light + water + light * water</p>
      <p>how would we go about predicting the mean heights? The GLM would look
        like this:</p>
      <p>height = β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> lightIndirect + β<sub>3</sub>
        lightNone + β<sub>4</sub> waterNone + β<sub>5</sub> lightIndirect x
        waterNone + β<sub>6</sub> lightNone x waterNone</p>
      <p>For a plant that was grown in direct light with no water, we would
        substitute the appropriate 0's and 1's for the dummy-coded terms, and
        that would give us:</p>
      <p>height = β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> 0 + β<sub>3</sub> 0 + β<sub>4</sub>
        1 + β<sub>5</sub> 0 + β<sub>6</sub> 0</p>
      <p>A plant that was grown in indirect light with no water would look like
        this:</p>
      <p>height = β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> 1 + β<sub>3</sub> 0 + β<sub>4</sub>
        1 + β<sub>5</sub> 1 + β<sub>6</sub> 0</p>
      <p>The 0's and 1's used for dummy coding are a way of identifying which of
        the coefficients are used in calculating the mean heights for any given
        combination of levels.</p>
      <p>A list of all the combinations possible, along with a matrix of 0's and
        1's that indicate which coefficients are needed to calculate the mean
        for that combination, is here:</p>

      <p>The matrix on the right is called the design matrix. In addition to the
        dummy coding, we needed to add a 1 for the intercept to make sure it
        would be used for all of the calculations of means.</p>
      <p>We can use the design matrix along with a matrix of coefficients from
        our model to calculate all the means for all the combinations shown to
        the left, using matrix multiplication. First, we arrange the design
        matrix and the coefficients like so:</p>
      <img alt="Predicting means - step one" src="predicted_means.png"><br>
      <p>Matrix multiplication involves multiplying across the rows of the left
        matrix, and down the columns of the right, and adding products of
        matching elements. The result that we get will have the number of rows
        of the left (design) matrix, and the number of columns of the right
        (coefficient) matrix, so we'll make a matrix with a single column and
        six rows (a matrix with a single row or a single column is called a <strong>vector</strong>,
        so the result will be a vector of means for each of our combinations of
        light and water). </p>
      <p>For example, to calculate the first combination (direct light, adequate
        water), the calculation is:</p>
      <p>1 x 16.10 + 0 x 13.17 + 0 x -10.90 + 0 x -10.60 + 0 x -13.27 + 0 x 9.80
        = 16.10 </p>
      <p>This gives us the first row of our vector of means - row 1 of the
        design matrix, column 1 of the coefficient vector gives us row 1, column
        1 of the vector of means.</p>
      <p>The next combination, indirect light with adequate water, is:</p>
      <p>1 x 16.10 + 1 x 13.17 + 0 x 13.17 + 0 x -10.90 + 0 x -10.60 + 0 x
        -13.27 + 0 x 9.80 = 29.27</p>
      <p>Row 2 of the design matrix, column 1 of the coefficient vector gives us
        row 2, column 1 of the vector of means. We would keep working our way
        down the rows of the design matrix, until we get a complete vector of
        means, like so:</p>
      <img alt="Predicted means 2" src="predicted_means1.png"><br>
      <p>The second matrix we need is the contrast matrix, and it has a
        different purpose and a different structure from the design matrix. The
        contrast matrix specifies which means will be compared to one another in
        our post-hoc procedure. If we were only focusing on a Tukey comparison
        of light levels, we would need a contrast matrix that looks like this:</p>
      <img alt="Just light levels" src="contrasts_just_light.png"><br>
      <p>The row labels give the comparison being made. Within the body of the
        matrix are 0's, 1's, and -1's which indicate which means are being
        compared. A -1 assigned to the first mean and a 1 to the second mean
        causes the first to be subtracted from the second. You'll see that each
        row specifies one mean subtracted from another, and the 1's and -1's are
        assigned to make this subtraction. Each row is called a "contrast".</p>
      <p>However, we don't want to compare marginal means for a main effect, we
        have a significant interaction. Instead, we want to condition the
        comparisons on the water level, which we can accomplish that by
        modifying the matrix like so:</p>
      <img alt="Light given water" src="contrasts_light_given_water.png"><br>
      <p>Now we have six contrasts specified, with the first part of the row
        labels indicating the water level, separated with a colon from the rest
        of the label which shows which light level means are actually being
        compared. The first three contrasts are combinations of light level
        given adequate water, and the second three contrasts are comparisons
        among light levels given no water. This contrast matrix has six rows to
        represent all the contrasts we want to test, as well as six columns - we
        needed to add a second set of three columns so we could split the means
        based on the water level.</p>
      <p>To calculate the differences between the means for our Tukey tests we
        just need to multiply this contrast matrix by the set of predicted means
        we calculated earlier, like so:</p>
      <img alt="Differences" src="differences.png"><br>
      <p>You can hopefully see that this matrix multiplication multiplies one
        mean to be compared by -1 and the other by 1, then adds them together,
        which is the same as subtracting the first from the second.</p>
      <p>So, putting it all together, we did the calculation:</p>
      <p>[contrast matrix] x [design matrix] x [coefficients] = differences</p>
      <p>We did the design matrix x coefficients step first to get means, and
        then multiplied the contrast matrix by the means to get the differences.</p>
      <p>This is essentially what the script I gave you does, except that glht()
        just wants the contrast matrix multiplied by the design matrix as input
        - it takes care of calculating means and differences itself. To do this
        in R requires that we generate the design matrix and contrast matrix,
        multiply them together, and then use the result as the linfct statement
        in glht(). </p>
      <p>The exact steps for getting these matrices in R are a little
        complicated - there are extensive comments in the script explaining what
        it does, and I will be happy to walk you through it if you are
        interested.</p>
