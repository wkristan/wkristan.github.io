      <p class="part">So far we have focused on understanding how the General
        Linear Model can be used to reproduce the results of an ANOVA, various
        t-tests, or simple linear regression. In addition to this versatility,
        the GLM can be easily extended to more than a single predictor variable.
        When we have more than one numeric predictor that we use to explain
        variation in the response variable we are conducting a <strong>multiple
          regression</strong>. </p>
      <p class="part">Multiple regression is not a completely new topic to us
        because we used multiple regression to learn how categorical variables
        are used in a GLM. If you recall, we converted a single column made up
        of cyanobacteria densities into a set of 0/1 dummy-coded numeric
        variables, which were then entered into a multiple regression analysis.
        From this we obtained a single intercept and slope coefficients for each
        dummy coded variable. The intercept was interpreted as the mean for the
        baseline group (i.e. the density coded as 0 across all the dummy
        variables), and the slopes were the difference between the baseline
        density and the density represented by the dummy-coded predictor (i.e.
        the density whose name matched the column name, and thus that received a
        1 for the column).</p>
      <p>Although that application of multiple regression is a clever way to
        obtain ANOVA results in a GLM, it is not usually what we mean by
        multiple regression. Usually multiple regression refers to a model with
        two or more numeric predictors that are used to explain a single
        response variable. Each predictor gets its own line in the ANOVA table,
        and will receive a <strong>partial slope</strong> coefficient that
        measures the relationship between the response and the predictor after
        controlling for the effect of the other predictors in the model. </p>
      <p>One of the important features of a typical multiple regression analysis
        is that the predictors will be correlated to some degree. Understanding
        how the correlation between the predictors affects the results is an
        important part of using multiple regression successfully.</p>
      <p>Today we will explore cases in which 1) including a second predictor
        increases our ability to detect the effect of the first, 2) use of two
        highly correlated predictors makes it impossible to attribute responses
        uniquely to either one, and 3) use of multiple predictors reveals an
        apparent relationship to be spurious.</p>
      <h2>Exercise<br>
      </h2>
      <p>Start a new project for today's exercise in R Studio (call the folder
        "multreg"), and download <a href="multiple_regression.Rmd">this R
          markdown file</a> for your commands. We will use data from <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2012$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=283;dataMax=110808$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=18;dataMax=87$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=;example=75">gapminder.org</a>
        for this exercise. The Gapminder project is a collection of data about
        various aspects of health, demography, and economic development of the
        countries of the world. It is not particularly biological, apologies,
        but it is interesting, and we will focus on a few things (like life
        expectancy, birth rate, and various public health measures) that have
        some link to biology.</p>
      <p>The data set we will use today is <a href="gapminder.xlsx">here</a>.
        Download and import the file into a data frame called "gapminder" in the
        import.gapminder chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>.</p>
      <p>If you open the gapminder data set to view it you'll see the variables
        included in the data set are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Country - the country the data pertains to. Country would only be
          used as a label, but is not a predictor or response variable.</li>
        <li>Life.expectancy - the average lifespan expected at birth. Infant
          mortality is included in this measure. <strong><em>Life expectancy
              will be the response variable for all of our analyses.</em></strong>
          The remaining variables will be used as predictors.<strong><em><br>
            </em></strong></li>
        <li>logPop.Density - log of population density, which is the natural log
          of the number of people per unit area, at the level of the entire
          country (that is, population size divided by the area of the country).</li>
        <li>logGDP - log of per-capita gross domestic product. This is economic
          output (GDP) divided by population size, then log transformed.</li>
        <li>Cholesterol - total cholesterol (mmol/L) in blood of men.
          Standardized for differences in age distribution.<br>
        </li>
        <li>TB - existing cases of all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 people
          in the population.</li>
        <li>Maternal.mortality - maternal deaths per live birth, multiplied by
          100,000 (so, number of women who die in childbirth per 100,000 live
          births).</li>
        <li>Babies.per.woman - children per woman in the population, including
          women who do not have children.</li>
        <li>Birth.rate - crude birth rate, which is births per 1000 people in
          the population.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Variables that are described as "Log of ..." are natural logs of each
        measurement. To use regression we need the relationship between life
        expectancy and each of the predictors to be <strong>linear</strong>,
        and log transformation can change a curvilinear relationship into a
        linear one. We'll learn more about transformations when we talk about
        assumptions of GLM later this semester, but for now just bear in mind
        that natural logs are exponents of the base e (which is a constant equal
        to approximately 2.718). So, for example, the minimum logGDP of 4.539 is
        actually e<sup>4.539</sup> = $93.60 per person per year, and the maximum
        of 10.940 is e<sup>10.940</sup> = $56,387 dollars per person per year -
        the differential doesn't look so big on a log scale, because 10.940 is
        only 2.4 times bigger than 4.539, but this translates into a maximum GDP
        that is 602 times bigger than the minimum GDP of $93.60.</p>
      <p>For multiple regression we need to have a single row for each
        observation, and a column for each variable - this is the <strong>multivariate</strong>
        data arrangement, used when we have multiple variables measured on the
        same subjects.</p>
      <p>Multiple regression requires <strong>complete data</strong>, meaning
        that there are no missing values. In a multiple regression if there is a
        single missing value in any of the variables used for the analysis the
        data point must be dropped from the analysis - if you look through this
        version of the data set you'll see that there are no rows with missing
        data, but there were a couple of countries I omitted because they did
        not have complete data.</p>
      <p>We will use these data to explore what multiple regression can be used
        for, and how correlations between predictor variables affects the
        analysis and interpretation. </p>
      <h2 id="case1" class="part">Case 1: Improving detection of the effects of
        one predictor by including another predictor</h2>
      <p>Even in a well controlled lab experiment a single predictor will
        generally not account for all of the variation in the response variable.
        Some of the variation in response is truly random, and thus not
        explainable - this random, unexplainable variation is the noise that
        goes into the residual term, and makes it difficult for us to detect the
        relationship we are trying to detect. However, some of the seemingly
        random variation in response may actually be explainable if we account
        for the variables that cause it. If we account for variation we can take
        it out of the residual term, which makes it easier for us to detect the
        effects we're interested in. Including a predictor to account for a <strong>nuisance</strong>
        variable (i.e. one that affects our experiment, but is not interesting
        scientifically) is called <strong>statistical elimination</strong>.</p>
      <p>Our first gapminder example explores the relationship between
        population density and life expectancy. To begin, we should graph the
        relationships.</p>
      <img src="logpop.png" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px" alt="Graph">
      <p>1. Make a graph of Life.expectancy (y axis) against logPop.Density (x
        axis) using ggplot. Add points, and add the regression line (using
        geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) to get the regression line without
        standard error bands). Put your ggplot() function in the
        graph.life.exp.against.logPop.Density chunk of your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>.</p>
      <p>Your graph will look like the one on the left. You'll see that the
        regression line is suggesting a positive relationship, but it's not very
        convincing - there is a great deal of scatter around the line,
        presumably because of all the other things that cause variation in life
        expectancy other than the density of the population in a country. </p>
      <p>But, the line indicates there may be a positive relationship, so we
        should see if it's statistically significant.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="clear:both">2. Run a linear model of Life.expectancy (response)
        on logPop.Density (predictor), and assign it to an object called
        life.logpop.lm - put this in the code chunk called
        life.logpop.simple.linear.regression of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>.</p>
      <p>In the same code chunk, use the summary() command to get the regression
        coefficient and p-value for life.logpop.lm - you will see output that
        looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call:<br>
        lm(formula = Life.expectancy ~ logPop.Density, data = gapminder)<br>

        F-statistic: 8.493 on 1 and 160 DF,&nbsp; p-value: <span style="color: blue">0.004075</span></p>
      <p>The coefficient for logPop.Density is 1.67 (highlighted in yellow),
        indicating that life expectancy increases by 1.67 years with each unit
        of increasing log population density (since this is on a natural log
        scale each 1 unit of increase is an e<sup>1</sup> = 2.72 -fold increase
        in population density, so this coefficient is telling us that 1.67 years
        of life expectancy are being added every time the population density
        gets 2.72 times larger).</p>
      <p>The summary() output also gives you results of the <strong>omnibus
          test</strong> of the model - this is reported below the coefficients,
        starting with "Residual standard error:". The omnibus test p-value is in
        blue here to help you find it. With just one numeric predictor the
        omnibus test matches the coefficient test for the slope. You can see
        from the omnibus p-value that the regression is significant, but we also
        need to know how strong the relationship is - our measure of the
        percentage of variation in Life.expectancy explained by the model is the
        Multiple R-squared, in red text here (there is only one predictor, so
        this is not really a multiple R<sup>2</sup> yet, but R doesn't change
        the labeling when you only have one variable). You'll see that although
        the model is statistically significant, the explained variation is tiny
        - only 5% of the variation in life expectancy is explained by
        logPop.Density - thus, the linear relationship is not likely to be due
        to random chance, but it is not very strong, either.</p>
      <p>Before you go on you should also get the <strong>ANOVA table</strong>
        for this analysis, using the anova() command on your fitted model object
        (in the same code chunk, below summary()). The table looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Response: Life.expectancy<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Df&nbsp; Sum Sq Mean Sq F value&nbsp;&nbsp; Pr(&gt;F)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        logPop.Density&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 869.7&nbsp; 869.71&nbsp; 8.4933
        0.004075 **<br>
        Residuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160 16383.8&nbsp; 102.40&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Again, with just one predictor this table just reproduces the omnibus
        test we got in the summary() output, so this test of logPop.Density, the
        omnibus test output from summary(), and the coefficient test for the
        slope of logPop.Density are all the same.</p>
      <p>3. In addition to population density, another thing we might expect
        would affect life expectancy is wealth. We can look at the relationship
        between life expectancy and wealth with a second graph - use
        Life.expectancy as the y-axis variable, but use logGDP as the x-axis
        variable. Put your command in the graph.life.exp.vs.loggdp chunk of your
        <strong>R markdown file</strong>. </p>
      <img src="loggdp.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">
      <p>You should get a graph that looks like the one on the left. This
        relationship is more convincing - there is less scatter around the line,
        and a clearer positive trend. But, we should test this trend for
        statistical significance as well.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p style="clear:both">4. Run a model that only includes logGDP as a
        predictor of life expectancy, and assign it to an object called
        life.loggdp.lm (in the life.loggdp.simple.linear.regression code chunk
        of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>If you use summary() on your life.loggdp.lm object you will get
        coefficients and model statistics:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call:<br>
        lm(formula = Life.expectancy ~ logGDP, data = gapminder)<br>

        F-statistic: 291.9 on 1 and 160 DF,&nbsp; p-value: &lt; <span style="color: blue">2.2e-16</span></p>
      <p> You'll see that logGDP is also a statistically significant predictor
        of life expectancy, with a slope of 5.19 (yellow highlight - interpret
        this as 5.19 years of increased life expectancy per 1 unit increase in
        logGDP). The explained variation for the model is higher, with an r<sup>2</sup>
        of 0.6459 (red), which tells us that 64.6% of the variation in
        Life.expectancy is explained by logGDP. The overall model is highly
        statistically significant (p-value in blue).</p>
      <p>Get the ANOVA table for this analysis as well (using anova()). We still
        have just one predictor, so the p-value on your ANOVA table matches the
        omnibus test from the summary() output.</p>
      <p>5. Now that we see that both logGDP and logPop.Density are
        statistically significant predictors of Life.expectancy, we might want
        to include both of them in a multiple regression to see if the patterns
        change in any way when both of these variables are used at once.</p>
      <p>When we include two variables at once the amount of correlation between
        them can become very important. If the correlated part of predictors is
        what explains variation in the response we can have issues, and the
        chances this will be the case increases if the correlations are strong.
        We can check how much correlation there is between the predictors with
        (in the correlate.logGDP.and.logPop.Density chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(gapminder, cor(logPop.Density, logGDP))</p>
      <p>You will see that the correlation coefficient is r = 0.09, which is a
        weak correlation. Including both of the predictors in a multiple
        regression together is unlikely to cause problems in our interpretation
        of the results, like we will experience in Case 2, below.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>6. We can now run the multiple regression of life expectancy on both
        logGDP and logPop.Density. To change our models into multiple
        regressions all we need to do is to include both predictors in the model
        with a + sign between them, like so (in the
        life.logpop.loggdp.multiple.regression chunk of your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">life.logpop.loggdp.lm &lt;- lm(Life.expectancy ~
        logPop.Density + logGDP, data = gapminder)</p>
      <p>Use summary() to get the model output (in the same chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>, after the lm() function) - we will focus first
        on the omnibus test:</p>
      <p class="rout">Residual standard error: 6.001 on 159 degrees of freedom<br>
        Multiple R-squared:&nbsp; 0.6682,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjusted
        R-squared:&nbsp; 0.664 <br>
        F-statistic: 160.1 on 2 and 159 DF,&nbsp; p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16</p>
      <p>Now that we have two predictors, the omnibus test tells us how well the
        two included variables together explain variation in the response. The
        multiple R-squared pertains to variation explained by the model, with
        both variables included - it is a little higher than the logGDP simple
        linear regression, and much higher than the logPop.Density simple linear
        regression, and since we now have more than one predictor it is indeed a
        multiple R<sup>2</sup>. The p-value also pertains to the model as a
        whole - the F-statistic has the explained variation for the entire model
        in the numerator, and with two predictors we test it with 2 numerator DF
        (159 denominator DF is n - number of predictors - 1). The model as a
        whole is statistically significant, and it explains 66.8% of the
        variation in life expectancy.</p>
      <p>Now, to move on to the model coefficients:</p>
      <p class="rout"> Coefficients:<br>

        Signif. codes:&nbsp; 0 â€˜***â€™ 0.001 â€˜**â€™ 0.01 â€˜*â€™ 0.05 â€˜.â€™ 0.1 â€˜ â€™ 1</p>
      <p>The Estimate column has the intercept and slope estimates. What you can
        get from these tests is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intercept - not much to learn from the intercept in this analysis.
          The intercept is the value of life expectancy predicted when logGDP
          and logPop.Density are both 0 - however, since the lowest logGDP is
          4.54,and the lowest logPop.Density is 0.5224 we can't have much
          confidence that this represents a meaningful estimate. In general it
          is a bad idea to extrapolate a statistical model beyond the range of
          the observed data, because we don't know if the model is still linear
          below the minimum observed data values. Intercepts are needed to make
          the line go through the data set, but they are often well outside of
          the range of data observed, and are usually not interpreted.</li>
        <li>logPop.Density and logGDP partial slope coefficients - the slopes
          are the important coefficients for this analysis, because they tell us
          how much change in life expectancy to expect with one unit of change
          in the log of population density (1.1168 years), and how much change
          in life expectancy to expect with a 1 unit change in logGDP (5.0982
          years). Because these are partial slope coefficients, they are the
          contribution of each variable independent of the other variable in the
          model. The logPop.Density coefficient is the predicted change in
          Life.expectancy independent of logGDP, and likewise the logGDP
          coefficient is the predicted change in Life.expectancy independent of
          logPop.Density. Both of these estimates are statistically significant
          - p-values for both are less than 0.05.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the partial slope coefficients are a little lower than the
        coefficients from the simple linear regressions, but they have smaller
        p-values. This may be a little surprising, and counter-intuitive -
        remember that the null hypothesis in a regression is that the slope is
        equal to 0, and it seems that a slope that is closer to 0 would have a
        higher p-value, and may not be significant at all. But, if you look at
        the p-value for logPop.Density alone it is 0.004, whereas the p-value
        for logPop.Density is 0.00134 when it is included in a model with
        logGDP. How is it possible for a smaller slope to be more statistically
        significant?<br>
      </p>
      <p>To understand why this happened, let's look at the two ANOVA tables
        that include logPop.Density - the ANOVA table you got for logPop.Density
        alone should look like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Response: Life.expectancy<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Df&nbsp; Sum Sq Mean Sq F value&nbsp;&nbsp; Pr(&gt;F)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        logPop.Density&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 869.7&nbsp; 869.71&nbsp; 8.4933
        0.004075 **<br>
        Residuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160 <span style="background-color: yellow">16383.8</span>&nbsp;
        102.40&nbsp; </p>
      <p>When the two predictors are included in a multiple regression the ANOVA
        table is:</p>
      <p class="rout">Response: Life.expectancy<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Df&nbsp; Sum Sq Mean Sq F value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        logPop.Density&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 869.7&nbsp;&nbsp; 869.7&nbsp;
        24.153 2.196e-06 ***<br>
        logGDP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1
        10658.5 10658.5 296.006 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***<br>
        Residuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 159&nbsp; <span style="background-color: yellow">5725.2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        36.0&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In the table of logPop.Density alone the residual SS is big, because
        only the effects of logPop.Density are being accounted for, and the
        effects of logGDP are not - any variation in life expectancy that isn't
        accounted for with a predictor variable is treated as random variation,
        so the 11,144.5 SS that was accounted for by logGDP above is in the
        residual SS. Since the residual MS is residual SS/residual DF, this big
        residual SS is making the denominator of the F ratio bigger, resulting
        in a smaller F-ratio for the test of logPop.Density, and a larger
        p-value.</p>
      <p>In the second table both predictors are included, and 10658.5 SS has
        been taken out of the residual SS and attributed to the effect of
        logGDP. As a result, the residual MS is much smaller (36, instead of
        102.40), which means that the same amount of variation explained by
        logPop.Density is being compared to a much smaller amount of
        unexplained, random variation - the F ratio is thus bigger, and the
        p-value much smaller for the test of logPop.Density when logGDP is
        accounted for.</p>
      <h3>Types of SS in ANOVA</h3>
      <p>We haven't had to worry about types of sums of squares in our work so
        far, because they are a non-issue when you only have one predictor (as
        in a simple linear regression) or when the predictors are tested
        together as a group (as in our dummy-coded categorical variables).</p>
      <p>But, when more than a single numeric predictor is used there will
        almost always be some amount of correlation between them, which means
        that some of the variation in each predictor is shared with the other.
        The shared parts of the predictors will often be responsible for some of
        the variation that the predictors collectively explain in the response.
        Since we can't know based on statistics alone if this shared variation
        is really due to the effects of one variable (with the other just
        correlated with the first variable, with no actual causal relationship
        with the response), or is truly due to the combined effects of both, we
        have to make a judgment call about what to do with the variation in the
        response that is explained by this correlated part of the predictor
        variables. The choices we'll use in this class will be to either to
        assign it to one of the variables (Type I SS), or to throw it out and
        assign it to neither variable (Type II SS).</p>
      <p>R's anova() command produces Type I SS tables, which is all we have
        worked with so far. A Type I SS ANOVA tests the first variable entered
        in the model first, which assigns all of the shared variation to that
        first predictor. The second predictor is then tested, but it is only
        allowed to explain variation that is independent of the first predictor.
        With just two predictors, this means that logPop.Density in the ANOVA
        table, above, is being assigned all of the variation it explains
        uniquely, as well as the variation it shares with logGDP. This is why,
        for the first time, the p-value in our ANOVA table is not the same as
        the p-value on the coefficient test for logPop.Density - the partial
        slope coefficient is only testing the independent contribution of
        logPop.Density, but the logPop.Density row of the ANOVA table includes
        variation in life expectancy that logPop.Density and logGDP explain
        together.</p>
      <p>If we only want to test how each predictor affects the response
        independent of the other predictor we need to use Type II SS ANOVA
        instead. In a Type II ANOVA each variable is tested as though it was the
        last added to the model, so that only the variation explained that is
        independent of the rest of the predictors is used to test the variable.
        We can get a Type II SS test of logPop.Density by running a second model
        in which it is entered after logGDP - in the <strong>console</strong>
        type:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(lm(Life.expectancy ~ logGDP + logPop.Density, data =
        gapminder))</p>
      <p>You will get this table:</p>
      <p class="rout">Analysis of Variance Table<br>
        <br>

      <p>With logPop.Density entered last it can only explain the variation that
        logGDP does not, and the p-value on logPop.Density matches the p-value
        for the partial coefficient test.</p>
      <p>It's a nuisance to have to run different versions of the same model to
        get Type II SS tests for every predictor. There is a built-in R function
        that will do this in an automated way for us, called drop1(), but there
        is a good alternative in an add-on library that we will use instead. The
        command is Anova() (with a capital A), found in the <strong>car</strong>
        library. Use the commands (in the typeII.SS.anova.table.life.popdens.gdp
        chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>): </p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(car)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">Anova(life.logpop.loggdp.lm)</p>
      <p>You will see the following ANOVA table:</p>

        </p>
      <p>With both variables only assigned the SS they explain independent of
        one another, the p-value on the test of logPop.Density now matches the
        test of the logPop.Density partial slope coefficient. Note that the
        output identifies this as a Type II SS table, and (for no particular
        reason) the SS and DF columns are reversed compared with the Type I
        table we get from anova(). Since each variable is tested as though it's
        the last one entered the order you list the variables in your lm()
        doesn't matter when you use Type II tables, the results will be the
        same.</p>
      <p>Generally, Type II SS tests are easier to interpret because they focus
        on the independent effects of predictors and give results that match the
        partial slope coefficients. But, we will use the difference in results
        between Type I and Type II SS tests to help us understand how the shared
        variation between predictors is affecting our interpretation of the
        results. We will make use of this approach in both Case 2 and Case 3
        below.</p>

      <p>7. Analyses with more than one predictor can be hard to understand, and
        it is helpful to visualize what the analysis is doing. Visualizing this
        relationship requires a 3D graph. To interpret a 3D scatterplot,
        understand that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two predictor variables form the bottom axes on the graph -
          labels for Log GDP and Log Pop. Dens. appear along the two axes at the
          base of the graph. </li>
        <li>The response variable is the "z" vertical axis - this is Life
          Expect., labeled along the vertical. </li>
        <li>The points are the individual countries, plotted by their
          Log.PopDens, LogGDP, and Life.expectancy values.</li>
        <li>The plane gives the predicted values for the multiple regression -
          we interpret this just like a regression line, but with two predictors
          we get a plane instead of a line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, this graph is set up to show the <strong>residuals</strong>
        for each country:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The vertical lines between the points and the regression plane are
          the residuals - that is, the differences between observed life
          expectancies and those predicted by the multiple regression model (as
          represented by the plane).</li>
        <li>Long vertical residual lines indicate that the country is far from
          the value predicted by the model. Purple lines extend below the plane
          to indicate countries with shorter lives than predicted by their
          population densities and GDPs, whereas gold lines extend above the
          plane to indicate countries with longer life expectancies than
          predicted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The graph is interactive - as you move your mouse over the points the
        name of the country will pop up, and you can rotate it by grabbing it
        with the mouse and moving it around. You can answer the questions about
        which countries have high or low life expectancies given their
        population densities and GDP's by finding the big residuals above or
        below the plane, and then hovering over their points to get the country
        names.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Note that it is possible to measure the separate effects of logGDP and
        logPop.Density on Life.expectancy because of the relative lack of
        correlation between the predictors. The largely uncorrelated variation
        in the two predictors means that the data are distributed across much of
        the surface of the plane, which gives us a lot of information about how
        the plane tilts along the log GDP axis, and how it tilts along the Log
        Pop. Dens. axis. You will see in the next example that an extremely high
        correlation between babies per woman and birth rate greatly restricts
        how the data is distributed across the plane, which makes it impossible
        to measure the unique contributions of the two variables.</p>
      <p>Also note that there is some evidence that a linear relationship may
        not be working well, particularly at high levels of GDP and population
        density - all of the countries at the highest combinations of GDP and
        population density are below the plane because the points seem to
        flatten out around a life expectancy of 80 or so, even though the plane
        continues to predict higher values - these countries are presumably
        bumping up against the biological limits of human life span, whereas
        poorer countries tend to die before encountering these limits, which is
        an effect that isn't being modeled well.</p>
      <h3>Importance of predictors and units of slopes</h3>
      <p>LogGDP seems to be a better predictor than logPop.Density, but just how
        much better is it? At this point we have estimates of slopes for each
        predictor, and we know that bigger slopes are further from the null
        value of Î² = 0, and are more likely to be statistically significant.
        Given this, we would think that the slope coefficient of 1.12 for
        logPop.Density has less effect on Life.expectancy than logGDP, with its
        slope of 5.10. However, there's a problem with this interpretation.</p>
      <p>The magnitude of the slope is affected by two things: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The strength of the relationship between the predictor and response
        </li>
        <li>The units of measure of each variable. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A slope coefficient has units of (response variable units/predictor
        variable units). The response variable is life expectancy, which is
        measured in years. The units of the predictors are the log of population
        density (which is measured in people per square kilometer), and log of
        economic production per person (measured in dollars). Predicted values
        in a regression are in the units of the response variable, so a slope
        has to translate the units of the predictor into the units of the
        response, and this conversion will be different for predictor variables
        with different units of measure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We can correct for this problem using <strong>standardized
          coefficients</strong>, which convert the units on the slopes to
        standard deviations. The standardized slope coefficients represent how
        many <em>standard deviations</em> of change in the response occurs with
        1 <em>standard deviation</em> of change in a predictor. </p>
      <p>5. R doesn't report standardized coefficients by default, but you can
        calculate them by using <strong>scaled</strong> variables - that is, by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for the
        predictors and response variable. Scaled variables have means of 0 and
        standard deviations of 1, and the regression coefficients can be
        interpreted as the number of standard deviations of change in the y
        variable that occurs with 1 standard deviation of change in x. You can
        get them by using the scale() function in your lm() command - put into
        the life.logpop.loggdp.std.coeff code chunk in your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>: </p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">life.logpop.loggdp.std.lm &lt;-

        the coefficients from the un-standardized variables above. They are 0.15
        for logPop.Density, and 0.79 for logGDP. Since both slopes are now in
        the same units (standard deviations) the only reason for them to be
        different is because of their different strength of relationship with
        life expectancy, and we can see that logGDP's effect on life expectancy
        is over five times bigger than logPopDensity's effect. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2 class="part" id="case3">Case 2: Effects of strongly correlated
        predictors can't be told apart.<br>
      </h2>
      <p>In our first analysis there was enough independent variation between
        logGDP and logPop.Density that we could measure their independent
        contributions to life expectancy. This is not always the case, though -
        when correlations between predictors are really high we may not have
        enough independent variation between the predictors for either of them
        to be statistically significant, even if collectively they explain a
        large amount of the variation in the response. Just as problematic, but
        not as obvious, is that the independent variation that is left to
        explain can be statistically significant, but is such a small fraction
        of the variation explained by the correlated parts of the variables that
        we base our interpretation on the relatively trivial independent effects
        while ignoring the much larger collective effects.</p>
      <p>When two or more predictors have a great deal of shared variation, and
        very little independent variation, their effects on the response
        variable can be <strong>confounded</strong>, meaning that it is
        impossible to statistically tell their effects apart. The consequences
        of including two correlated variables in a multiple regression together
        depends on whether it is the shared, correlated part of the predictor
        variables that's associated with change in the response, or the
        independent, uncorrelated parts. If the independent parts affect the
        response, then we'll be able to measure their independent effects in
        spite of the correlation between them. If the shared part is what is
        causing change in the response then we will not be able to tell which
        variable is responsible (it could either one alone or the combined
        effects of both, and we won't be able to tell the difference between
        these possibilities). </p>
      <p>There really isn't a statistical solution to confounding between
        variables, it's a design-level problem - we would need to collect a
        different data set that has less confounding between the variables to
        measure their independent effects. But, we can learn to recognize when
        our data set has confounded predictors so that we don't misinterpret our
        results.</p>
      <p>As an example of this problem we will use two highly correlated
        predictor variables: babies per woman, and birth rate. Babies per woman
        is calculated as number of babies born divided by number of women in the
        population, whereas birth rate divides the number of babies born by the
        number of people in the country, both men and women. These two variables
        are slightly different ways of measuring the same thing, and we can
        expect them to be highly correlated with one another. If every country
        had an identical sex ratio the two different variables would be
        perfectly correlated, but because of small differences in sex ratio
        among countries the correlation between them is very high, but not
        perfect.</p>
      <p>To begin, let's make some graphs.</p>
      <p>1. In chunk graph.life.birth of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>,
        make a scatter plot of life expectancy on birth rate, with a regression
        line:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = Birth.rate, y =
        Life.expectancy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)</p>
      <p>You will see a negative relationship between life expectancy and birth
        rate - higher birth rates are associated with lower life expectancies.
        In chunk graph.life.bpw of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>, make
        a scatter plot of life expectancy on babies per woman. You will also see
        a negative relationship, and the graphs will look very similar.</p>
      <p>We expect a strong correlation between birth rate and babies per woman,
        so to see how strongly related they are make a scatter plot of birth
        rate on babies per woman in the graph.birth.bpw chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>. You will see a very strong, positive
        relationship between these two predictor variables. In the same code
        chunk, after your plotting command, get the correlation coefficient for
        the two variables - you should see that r is 0.98, close to perfectly
        correlated.</p>
      <p>2. We see on the graphs what appears to be a strong negative
        relationship between both measures of reproduction and life expectancy,
        but we should confirm that these are statistically significant.</p>
      <p>Run a linear model of Life.expectancy on Birth.rate, and get its
        coefficients and ANOVA table (using summary() and anova(), in the
        life.birth.rate chunk of your <strong>R markdown file</strong>). You'll
        get this ANOVA table:</p>

      <p>You can see that these two measures of reproductive output are each

      <p>3. Now that we know each variable is highly statistically significant

      <p>Babies per woman is significant when it is entered first and tested
        with Type I SS ANOVA, but it is no longer significant when it is tested
        with Type II SS ANOVA. When you compare all of the summary outputs,
        you'll see that the partial coefficient test for babies per woman is not
        significant, either.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You can see that the 3D graph to the right looks different from the one
        we used for population density and GDP, in that the strong correlation
        between birth rate and babies per woman means that we don't have data
        distributed across the surface of the plane. If you rotate the graph so
        that life expectancy is pointing into the screen, birth rate is in the
        x-axis position, and babies per woman is in the y-axis position, you'll
        see the implication of this very strong correlation - when birth rate is
        low so is babies per woman, and when birth rate is high so is babies per
        woman, but there are no cases of low birth rates accompanied by high
        babies per woman, or high birth rates accompanied by low babies per
        woman. That leaves large areas of the graph empty of data, in the upper
        left and lower right quadrants.</p>
      <p>If you return the graph to its original orientation with life
        expectancy pointed upward, you will see that the lack of data in these
        quadrants gives the appearance that the plane of balancing precariously
        on a strip of data that's running diagonally through it. The statistical
        consequence of this situation is that we can't confidently ascribe a
        unique effect of either predictor on life expectancy, because nearly all
        of the variation that babies per woman explains in life expectancy could
        also be explained by birth rate. We have no statistical basis to say
        that this shared variation is due entirely to one or the other variable,
        or equally to both, or some distribution in between these two extremes,
        and the best conclusion to reach is that we have evidence that
        reproductive output is associated with life expectancy (based on the
        statistically significant model, and high model R<sup>2</sup> of 0.73),
        but we don't know the relative importance of babies per woman or birth
        rate to the relationship.</p>
      <p>But why, you might wonder, not at least conclude that Birth.rate is a
        better predictor than Babies.per.woman, when only Birth.rate is
        statistically significant?</p>

      <p>It may help to understand why this is a bad idea if we refer to this
        Venn diagram. The yellow circle circles are our predictors
        (Babies.per.woman and Birth.rate, respectively) and red circle is the
        response variable (Life.expectancy). Where the yellow and red circles
        overlap is the variation in Life.expectancy explained by
        Babies.per.woman, and where the blue and red circles overlap is the
        variation in Life.expectancy explained by Birth.rate.</p>
      <p>Where the yellow, blue, and red circles all overlap is the variation in
        Life.expectancy that is equally well explained by either Birth.rate or
        Babies.per.woman. If you click the image once, you will see this region
        shaded green. This is what causes all our difficulties, because while we
        know that this is variation in Life.expectancy that is explainable by
        these two measures of reproductive output collectively, there is no
        statistical way of knowing which predictor to assign it to. When we use
        partial coefficients or Type II SS ANOVA we address this problem by not
        assigning it to either one - we throw this part of the explained
        variation out, because it doesn't help us understand the effect of each
        predictor separately. This may be the majority of the variation
        explained, as it is shown here - most of the area of overlap of the red
        Life.expectancy circle with either of the predictors is in this
        problematic area.</p>
      <p>If you click the image a second time you will see the small sliver that
        overlaps just between Babies.per.woman and Life.expectancy - this is the
        variation in Life.expectancy explained only by Babies.per.woman, and
        it's a small amount. Babies.per.woman is not a significant predictor
        when Birth.rate is included because of this.</p>
      <p>Click once more and you'll see that Birth.rate has a larger amount of
        variation in Life.expectancy that is independent of Babies.per.woman.
        Because of this, Birth.rate is still statistically significant when it's
        included with Babies.per.woman.</p>

        <p> In this analysis, most of the variation in Life.expectancy that is

        <p>The SS assigned to Babies.per.woman in this table is actually the sum
          of the variation it explains alone, and the variation that is
          confounded between the predictors (i.e. that could be explained by
          either variable). Since Type I SS assigns the shared variation to the
          first predictor the sum of the two Sum Sq for Babies.per.woman and
          Birth.rate equals the total variation in Life.expectancy explained by
          the model - that is, the total explained variation is 12046.4 + 717.5

          for the Type I and Type II tables is the variation in Life.expectancy
          that is equally well explained by either Babies.per.woman or
          Birth.rate - that is, 12763.9 - 760.9 = 12003 is the variation
          explained by either predictor equally well.</p>
        <p>So, this means that:<br>

          <li>The part that is only attributable to Babies.per.woman is 100 x
            43.4/12763.9 = 0.4% of the total variation explained</li>
          <li>The part that is only attributable to Birth.rate is 100 x
            717.5/12763.9 = 5.6% of the total variation explained.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given that the vast majority of the variation in life expectancy
          could be attributed to either Babies.per.woman or Birth.rate, it isn't
          sensible to conclude that Babies.per.woman is a bad predictor of life
          expectancy. Likewise, the fact that there is enough independent
          variation in Birth.rate that it is a statistically significant
          predictor even when it's included with Babies.per.woman is not a
          strong justification for interpreting its effects alone - most of the
          variation in Life.expectancy that it explains is just as well
          explained by Babies.per.woman, and throwing 94% of the explained
          variation out to focus on 5.6% is not a great idea.</p>
        <p>The best conclusion to draw from this analysis is that reproductive
          rate is a good predictor of life expectancy, but that the relative
          importance of birth rate or babies per woman can't be determined with
          confidence because of the strong correlation between these two
          predictors.</p>

      <h2 class="part" id="case2">Case 3: Multiple regression can help identify
        spurious relationships.</h2>
      <p>Strong correlations between variables is a nuisance that can make
        multiple regression difficult to interpret. However, we can sometimes
        take advantage of confounded relationships between variables to help us
        understand <strong>spurious relationships</strong>.</p>
      <p>We will see how this works using data on life expectancy and blood
        cholesterol levels. </p>
      <p>1. Make a scatter plot of life expectancy (y-axis) on cholesterol
        (x-axis), including a regression line (in the graph.life.exp.on.chol
        chunk of your <b>R markdown file</b></p>
      <img src="chol.png" ,="" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px">
      <p>Your graph should look like the one on the left. There certainly seems
        to be a linear relationship between cholesterol level and life
        expectancy, but oddly the relationship is positive. Given what we know
        about the negative effects of blood cholesterol on heart health this is
        a little odd - we would expect a negative relationship, if any.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">2. Before we jump to conclusions, we should confirm
        that this apparent relationship is statistically significant. Run a
        linear model of Life.expectancy (response) against Cholesterol
        (predictor), and get the summary so that you can look at the
        coefficients (in the life.cholesterol.alone chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>). </p>
      <p style="clear:both">If you look at the slope on cholesterol you'll see
        that it's positive, and highly statistically significant - so, our
        impression from the scatterplot is supported by the statistical analysis
        - there is a significant positive relationship between cholesterol and
        life expectancy.</p>
      <p>But, before we rush out and wolf down some buttered eggs, we should
        check whether this odd finding is actually a spurious relationship. We
        already know from our analysis of Case 1 that the log of GDP is a good
        predictor of life expectancy, and as an indicator of wealth we would
        expect that countries with higher GDP should have higher levels of
        consumption of the meat and dairy products that add cholesterol to a
        diet. We might also expect that with increased wealth countries would
        have better healthcare, so even though blood cholesterol levels might be
        higher in rich countries, life expectancies might nevertheless be higher
        due to the generally better availability of medical care. If this is
        true, then the apparent positive effect of cholesterol on life
        expectancy may diminish or disappear entirely if we account for the
        known effects of wealth and healthcare on life expectancy first.</p>

      <p>To get an idea of how these variables are all inter-related, see the
        interactive 3D scatterplot to the right. Even with the luxury of a third
        dimension we can't plot every variable on its own axis, because we have
        five variables represented - logGDP and cholesterol are each on one of
        the base axes, and the vertical axis is life expectancy. The color of
        the points indicates rates of tuburculosis (higher rates indicating poor
        healthcare), and the size of the points indicates maternal mortality
        rates during childbirth (lower rates indicating better healthcare). As
        you hover over the points the values for all five of the variables are
        reported, and you can rotate the axes to see the relationships better.</p>
      <p>Since we will have more than two predictors of life expectancy in this
        analysis it wasn't possible to represent the plane in the graph (with
        four predictors it will be a four-dimensional hyperplane, which doesn't
        translate well to three dimensions). But, if you rotate the graph so
        that life expectancy runs into the screen, with logGDP in the x-axis
        position and cholesterol in the y-axis position, you'll see that there
        is a strong positive relationship between logGDP and cholesterol (watch
        the numbers on the axes - it's possible to orient the graph so that the
        numbers go in reverse order, and can make the relationship look
        negative). In this orientation you'll also see that the color gradient
        goes from dark to light as cholesterol increases, and the sizes of the
        points go from large to small with increasing cholesterol as well - both
        of these measures of health are evidently correlated with cholesterol
        too, as we expected.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">3. We can confirm our impression of the correlations
        between the predictors before we go on to our multiple regression
        analysis. To get the correlation between the four predictor variables,
        us the command (in the correlate.predictors.cholesterol chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p style="clear:both" class="rcmd">cor(gapminder[ ,c("Cholesterol",
        "logGDP","Maternal.mortality","TB")])</p>
      <p style="clear:both">This use of the cor() function takes a set of
        columns from the gapminder data set and calculates the correlations
        between all possible pairs of variables. We're identifying the columns
        to use by naming them in the column index position - the square
        brackets, [], attached to the gapminder dataset indicates that we're
        referring to row and column indexes. A blank in the row position, before
        the comma, says to use all the rows. The column position, after the
        comma, has a vector with a list of column names, which is used to select
        the columns we want to correlate.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">The result of this command is a <strong>correlation
          matrix</strong> that looks like this:</p>

      <p style="clear:both">A correlation matrix shows the correlation between
        every possible pair of variables - the variable names appear in both the
        row and column headings, and where two variable names intersect is the
        correlation between them. The order of the variables is the same in the
        rows and columns, so the diagonal (from upper left to lower right, in
        black text) is the correlation of variables with themselves, which will
        always be equal to 1. The correlations of cholesterol with the other
        predictors can be read down the first column, or across the first row -
        since the names are repeated in the rows and columns each pair of
        variables appears twice, so the upper triangle (above the diagonal in
        red) and the lower triangle (below the diagonal in blue) are mirror
        images of one another, and contain the same information. We can just
        pick one or the other sets of correlations to interpret.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">The correlations down the first column show that
        cholesterol is strongly positively correlated with logGDP, and
        moderately negatively correlated with Maternal.mortality and TB. These
        correlations are high, but not as high as the correlation between birth
        rate and babies per woman, so we might still be able to measure an
        effect of cholesterol independently of any one of these other predictors
        if they are included together. But, bear in mind that these correlation
        coefficients only measure the relationship between two variables at a
        time, and it's very likely that logGDP, Maternal.mortality, and TB
        collectively share even more variation with Cholesterol than any single
        one of them does alone.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">So, based on the graph and these correlations we
        have good reason to think that the apparent positive relationship of
        life expectancy with cholesterol could be a side-effect of wealth and
        good healthcare, but we still need to confirm this by including all of
        the predictors in a multiple regression.</p>
      <p style="clear:both">4. To test if the relationship between cholesterol
        and life expectancy is spurious we can run a multiple regression of
        Life.expectancy against Cholesterol, logGDP (as an indicator of wealth),
        Maternal.mortality, and TB (as indicators of effectiveness of health
        care and public health systems) in the life.cholesterol.wealth chunk of
        your <strong>R markdown file</strong>. <span style="color:red">MAKE

      <p>5. One way to understand the importance of the shared variation between
        the predictors in shaping our conclusions is to compare what a Type I SS
        ANOVA table tells us, compared with a Type II SS ANOVA table. The Type I
        table assigns all of the shared variation to the first predictor
        entered, and then assigns what is left to the second, and what is left
        after the first two are entered to the third, and only assigns variation
        explained independently to the final predictor. A Type II SS table only
        uses the independent variation to test for relationships with the
        response, so every variable is tested as though it was the last one
        entered (because of this the order the variables are listed in the model
        statement doesn't matter for Type II SS ANOVA).</p>
      <p>The anova() command we have been using so far gives sequential ("Type
        I") sums of squares, so use it now to get an ANOVA table with Type I
        sums of squares (in the life.typeI.ss chunk of your <strong>R markdown
          file</strong>). You will get this table:</p>

      <p>Since TB was entered last in the model only TB is the same in this
        table and the Type I SS table. You should see that cholesterol is not a
        significant effect in this table, because the variation in life
        expectancy that cholesterol can explain is also explained by these
        measures of wealth and healthcare.</p>
      <p>In a multiple regression the Type II SS table will match the
        coefficient tests, since the coefficients are partial relationships
        (that is, independent effects of variables, after the effects of the
        other predictors have been accounted for). You'll see that the p-values
        on each of these predictors in the Type II SS table are the same as on
        the partial coefficients in the model summary.</p>
      <p>6. What happened, exactly? Since we can't graph the plane in three
        dimensions with four predictors it's hard to visualize directly, and a
        Venn diagram with this many predictors is a bit messy. What we can do is
        to see how Cholesterol is related to Life.expectancy after the variation
        shared with logGDP, Maternal.mortality, and TB has been removed. </p>
      <p>First, we need to run a model of life expectancy on the predictors
        other than cholesterol, and get the residuals. The residuals are the
        variation in life expectancy that isn't explained by wealth and health.
        Use the command (in the cholesterol.residuals chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">gapminder$life.resid &lt;- residuals(lm(Life.expectancy ~
        logGDP + Maternal.mortality + TB, data = gapminder))</p>
      <p>The new life.resid column in the gapminder data set has the variation
        in life expectancy that is independent of logGDP, Maternal.mortality,
        and TB.</p>
      <p>We also need to get the variation in cholesterol that is independent of
        those other predictors, which we get the same way - this time we'll use
        Cholesterol as the response and logGDP, Maternal.mortality and TB as
        predictors (put this on the next row of the same code chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">gapminder$chol.resid &lt;- residuals(lm(Cholesterol ~
        logGDP + Maternal.mortality + TB, data = gapminder))</p>
      <p>The chol.resid values represent the variation in cholesterol that isn't
        correlated with the other predictors.</p>
      <p>Now that you have residuals that give us the variation in life
        expectancy that is independent of wealth and healthcare, and cholesterol
        level that is independent of wealth and healthcare, we can relate the
        life expectancy to the cholesterol residuals - this measures the
        relationship between life expectancy and cholesterol independent of the
        other predictors. First, graph them with a scatter plot with a line
        through the data (in the graph.indep.chol.var chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>). </p>
      <p>Then, run a linear model of the life.resid column on the chol.resid
        column, use summary() to get the coefficients, and anova() to get the
        ANOVA table (in the anova.indep.chol.var chunk of your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>). You should see this:</p>

      <p>Note that this analysis does not <em>prove</em> that the effect of
        cholesterol on life span is a spurious effect, due only to its
        correlation with wealth and healthcare. Based just on this analysis we
        would be equally justified in concluding that cholesterol is great for
        your health, and the fact that wealthy countries can afford diets rich
        in cholesterol contributes to their long life expectancies. All we know
        from the analysis is that there is no effect of cholesterol <em>independent
          of the wealth and health of the countries</em>. </p>
      <p>Our justification for deciding that cholesterol and life expectancy is
        a spurious positive relationship comes from what we already know about
        how cholesterol and wealth affect life expectancy. A great deal of
        medical knowledge tells us not to expect high cholesterol levels to
        improve life span, and that knowledge should make us skeptical that the
        positive relationship we detected using cholesterol alone as a predictor
        represent some sort of previously undiscovered benefit of high
        cholesterol (in other words, probably NOT "the shocking truth about
        cholesterol that doctors don't want you to know!"). On the other hand, a
        great deal of social sciences and public health knowledge tells us that
        wealth, and associated improvements in health care, lead to longer life
        spans. Since the apparent positive effect of cholesterol disappears when
        we include predictors we have a greater amount of well-justified
        confidence in, it is appropriate to conclude the effect of cholesterol
        is spurious. Just be aware that the statistics alone do not lead us to
        this conclusion, it is the statistics in combination with our scientific
        knowledge that gets us there.</p>
