      <p id="Intro" class="part">So far we have seen how GLM can model effects of categorical predictors (<strong>ANOVA</strong>)
        and numeric predictors (<strong>regression</strong>). We have also seen that it's easy to extend the GLM to
        model more than one numeric predictor (<strong>multiple regression</strong>). Since it's possible to model
        either categorical or numeric variables with a GLM, and to use more than one predictor at a time, it stands to
        reason that we should be able to use two predictors in the same model, one of which is categorical and the other
        of which is numeric. A model like this with a mix of categorical and numeric predictors is called <strong>Analysis
          of Covariance</strong>, or <strong>ANCOVA</strong>. </p>
      <p>We usually mix categorical and linear predictors for one of three reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>To improve a regression analysis</strong>. The regression is the scientifically important thing,
            but there is a grouping in the data that needs to be accounted for. We may need to account for a categorical
            nuisance variable (greenhouse, growth chamber), or a characteristic of our study organisms (species, sex,
            age class). Using ANCOVA allows us to have lines with different intercepts for each of the groups, which may
            fit the data much better than a single line would.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>To improve an ANOVA</strong>. Comparison among categorical treatment group levels is the
            scientifically important thing, but there is a continuous variable that adds statistical noise to the data
            that needs to be statistically eliminated. Examples like this often use a measure of initial conditions as a
            covariate (e.g. initial bacterial density, initial weights of mice, etc.) to compensate for our inability to
            hold all variables constant. There is often little or no association between the treatment groups and the
            covariate (that is, there may be no difference on average in the initial conditions between the treatment
            levels), so the primary effect of including the covariate is to remove random variation from the residual
            term.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>To make covariate-adjusted comparisons between groups</strong>. Comparison among treatment group
            levels is the important thing, but can't be done directly because of a confounded variable that we need to
            adjust for, but can't simply hold constant experimentally. A classic example of this type of analysis is
            mass-adjusting some feature of interest - using mass as a covariate compensates for our inability to set
            every individual to the same mass experimentally.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The GLM that we would use is the same in all three cases - we would have a numeric response explained by two
        predictors, one that is numeric and another that is categorical. The only difference would be in the part of the
        results on which we focus our attention.</p>
      <img alt="Silhouettes" src="rt_ch_ss.jpg" style="float: right; border: 1px solid; margin-left: 10px">
      <p>Today we will work on an example of the third case, in which we want to make covariate-adjusted comparisons
        between groups. Our question will be about differences between three species in their wings and tail lengths,
        which is complicated by large differences in the size of the species. We will use data from three species of
        birds of prey, red-tailed hawks (RT), Cooper's hawks (CH), and sharp-shinned hawks (SS), shown in the image to
        the right. A summary table of the weights (g), wing chords (which measures the length of the longest primary
        feather to the wrist, and is a standard measure of wing size, in mm), and tail lengths (mm) of these species
        shows us the following:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp; Species Weight&nbsp; Wing&nbsp; Tail<br>
        1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CH&nbsp; 415.6 243.7 202.6<br>
        2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RT 1098.8 386.3 222.8<br>
        3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SS&nbsp; 140.1 183.4 145.5</p>
      <p>RT are by far the biggest bird in the picture, and not surprisingly RT have the largest means on all three of
        these variables - as one might expect, big birds have big parts. However, you can see in the picture that RT are
        shaped very differently than the other two species. RT are in a group of hawks called the buteos that hunt
        ground-based prey, usually either from a perch or while soaring (soaring is a style of flight in which the wings
        are held outstretched without flapping, and the birds stay aloft by riding updrafts). In contrast, both CH and
        SS are accipiters, which hunt by chasing down smaller birds in flight through dense vegetation. Rather than
        being adapted to soaring, CH and SS need to be highly maneuverable. The illustration certainly makes it appear
        as though CH and SS have longer tails <em>for their body sizes</em> than RT. The wings of the accipiters also
        seem to be smaller than RT for their sizes, but the amount of difference is difficult to judge given the
        differences in overall size of the species - that is, comparison of shapes of the birds is confounded with
        differences in size.</p>
      <p>So, how do we make a comparison of the shapes of the species with respect to their wing and tail dimensions
        when they differ so much in their overall sizes?</p>
      <p>The first thing we should do is define weight as a simple measure of size.<strong></strong> As you learned in
        the experimental design activity, the ideal way to eliminate the confounding effects of a variable is to hold it
        constant experimentally, but we don't get to set the weights of these birds to desired values. Even if we could
        find some RT, CH, and SS that were all the same weight they would probably not be normal animals (the RT would
        be emaciated, and the CH and SS would be obese). But, we can correct for the differences in size by including
        weight as a covariate, so that we can estimate what the difference in wing and tail lengths between the species
        would be if we could make them the same size. </p>
      <div style="clear: both"> <img alt="Lots of red tails" src="size_only.jpg" style="float: right; border: 1px solid; margin-left: 20px">
        <h3>Possible outcomes</h3>
        <p>One possibility is that, despite the impression the picture above gives us, the hawks differ only in size but
          are the same shape. If this is the case then all three of the hawk species are essentially the same model that
          is scaled to different sizes. If that were the case, then the wing chords would look like the figure to the
          right, which shows the red-tailed hawk silhouette magnified to different sizes.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear: both"> <br>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both"> <img alt="Scale models" src="one_line.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid; margin-left: 20px">
        <p>If raptors were all just different magnifications of the same basic model, a regression of wing vs. body
          would look like the illustration to the right. A single line with a single intercept is fitted through all
          three of the species, and it fits well. If we adjusted for body mass by calculating the wing chords of each
          species at the same mass, this would be like sliding the RT and SS points along the line such that their mean
          body masses are the same as the CH in the middle, and all three would all have the same mass-adjusted wing
          chords.</p>
        <p>So, what would a GLM that included body size and species as predictors show if this is the outcome? Body size
          is explaining the wing chord well, and we don't need lines with different intercepts to explain the scaling
          relationship. Adding species as a categorical predictor only helps if we need different intercepts, so
          including species as a predictor would not be expected to improve the fit - species would not be a significant
          predictor as long as body size was also included.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both"> <img title="Parallel lines" alt="Parallel lines" src="parallel_lines.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid; margin-left: 20px">
        <p>But, if raptors aren't just different magnifications of the same basic model, each species might require a
          different line. If this is true a set of parallel lines would describe the data better than a single line
          could, like the graph to the right. The implication of using parallel lines is that we are assuming the
          scaling relationship is the same for every species, but they differ in wing chords at a given body weight -
          that is, the slope for the lines is the same, and only the intercepts differ. Since the lines are parallel,
          the difference between the intercepts represents the vertical difference between the lines, which is the same
          at any body weight. This vertical difference is a mass-adjusted comparison, since it compares what the wing
          chord would be for each species at a specified body weight.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So, for today, we will analyze the differences between these three species of raptor in their mass-adjusted
        wing chords, and in their mass-adjusted tail lengths. If we find that the species categorical variable is
        significant, then we'll conclude that the species are not just different scales of the same model - that is,
        they have different shapes, and not just different sizes. Once we have established that there is a difference
        between the species, we can also use our model to estimate wing chords and body lengths of all the species at a
        common weight - these "least squares means" are then used to interpret how much difference there is between
        species after accounting for the covariate.</p>
      <h2 class="part" id="size_corr">Analyze size-corrected differences in wing chord and body length. </h2>
      <p>1. Make a new project in R Studio called "ancova". The data set you will analyze is <a href="hawks.xlsx">here</a>,
        and here is the <a href="ancova.Rmd">Rmd</a> file - download both into the ancova project folder. Open the Rmd
        file, and write the commands needed to import the data into a data set called "hawks".</p>
      <p>If you open the hawks dataset and look it over, you'll see that there are columns for Species, Weight, Wing,
        and Tail, as well as some columns indicating the date that the bird was captured and measured, and its age and
        sex. We won't be using age or sex in this analysis, so the only categorical variable we will have is Species. We
        should convert Species to a factor (in your <strong>Rmd file</strong>, on the next line of the import.data code
        chunk): </p>
      <p class="rcmd">hawks$Species &lt;- factor(hawks$Species)</p>
      <p> 2. Now we are going to look at the data. First you need to load the ggplot2 library (plot.wings chunk of your
        <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(ggplot2)</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species, group = Species)) + geom_point(size =
        0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)</p>
      <p> This command is much like the scatterplot with a line through it that we've been using all semester, but by
        grouping and coloring by Species we get a separate line for each species' data - by making the points smaller
        you can see the lines better, and you'll see that they don't all seem to have the same slope. This is not
        surprising, because scaling of body parts is often <strong>allometric</strong>, meaning that the parts change
        at different rates. Weight is a volumetric property - the bigger the volume of the animal the heavier it will be
        - and for any change in a linear dimension the volume increases roughly to that amount cubed.</p>
      <p>We can potentially straighten out those lines by plotting axes on a log scale - the log of a number is the
        exponent needed to raise a base to equal the number. If we use log base 10, then the logs are the exponent
        needed to raise 10 to equal the number (the log base 10 of 10 is 1, of 100 is 2, of 1000 is 3, and so on). We
        can set an axis to use a log scale in ggplot with by adding scale_x_log10() or scale_y_log10() to our command.
        Let's set the x-axis to a log scale first to see if that's enough (add the scale command on to your existing
        ggplot() command, like so):</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species, group = Species)) + geom_point(size =
        0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + scale_x_log10()</p>
      <p>You'll see that CH and SS seem to have the same slope, but RT still do not, so let's set the y-axis to a log
        scale as well:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> ggplot(hawks, aes(x = Weight, y = Wing, color = Species, group = Species)) + geom_point(size =
        0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()</p>
      <p>This time the three lines seem to be more or less sharing the same slope, but to each have different
        intercepts, which is how the model will work when we run our ANCOVA. For the model to fit the data properly, we
        will want to use the log of wing chord and the log of weight.</p>
      <p>3. We can specify a log scale on graph axes easily enough, but if we are going to use the log of wing chord and
        the log of weight as our variables it's convenient to make log-transformed versions of them. The statistical
        results will be the same whether we use the log base 10 or natural logs (which are logs for the base e, which is
        an irrational constant equal to 2.178 for the first three decimal places). In R the log() function is for
        natural logs, and log10() is for log base 10. We'll go ahead and use natural logs - in the
        log.transform.wing.weight chunk of your <strong>Rmd</strong> file enter:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">hawks$log.wing &lt;- log(hawks$Wing)<br>
        hawks$log.weight &lt;- log(hawks$Weight)</p>
      <p>Your hawks dataset should now have 11 variables, the last two of which are log.wing and log.weight<br>
      </p>
      <p>4. Fit a linear model with log wing chord as the response variable, using log of mass and species as predictors
        (in that order). Call the model "wing.lm" (for "wing chord linear model") - in the wing.ancova.model chunk of
        your <strong>Rmd file</strong> enter:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">lm(log.wing ~ log.weight + Species, data = hawks) -&gt; wing.lm</p>
      <p>To see what is in this lm object, type its name below this line and run the code chunk - you should see:</p>
      <p class="rout">Call:<br>
        lm(formula = log.wing ~ log.weight + Species, data = hawks)<br>
        <br>
        Coefficients:<br>
        (Intercept)&nbsp;&nbsp; log.weight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpeciesRT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpeciesSS&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.907536&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.263949&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.202391&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        0.006265&nbsp; </p>
      <p>All that is displayed here is the call (which reproduces the command used), and the coefficients for each term.
        The intercept is the predicted log.wing for Cooper's hawks with log.weight of 0 - how did we know this? By
        definition, and intercept is the value of the response when all of the predictors are set to 0 - when SpeciesRT
        and SpeciesSS are both set to zero the bird is a CH, so the intercept is the expected log.wing for a CH with
        log.weight of 0.</p>
      <p>5. To get our ANOVA table for the model, use (in the wing.ancova.anova.table of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">anova(wing.lm)</p>
      <p>The ANOVA table looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Show in New Window<br>
        Analysis of Variance Table<br>
        <br>
        Response: log.wing<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Df&nbsp; Sum Sq Mean Sq&nbsp; F
        value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pr(&gt;F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        log.weight&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 101.037 101.037 56125.39 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***<br>
        Species&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.948&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.474&nbsp;&nbsp; 263.17 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***<br>
        Residuals&nbsp; 858&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.545&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.002&nbsp; </p>
      <p>You'll see that log.weight is a significant predictor, as is Species. This is a case in which we are trying to
        adjust for the effect of weight as a confounded, nuisance variable, so it should be entered first if we are
        going to use Type I SS ANOVA. The fact that log.weight is statistically significant supports our choice to
        account for the effect of weight on wing chord, but all it is telling us scientifically is that wing chord is
        related to the size of the birds - with a slope of 0.264 we have discovered that bigger birds have bigger wings.
        Not terribly surprising as a scientific question, but our purpose was to account for the effect of weight on
        wing chord, rather than to test whether it existed or not.</p>
      <p>The predictor we're actually interested in is Species - the fact that Species is significant tells us that
        there are differences between at least two of the species in their mass-adjusted wing chords, but we can't tell
        which from the ANOVA table. We can do Tukey comparisons to see which are different from which, and we would like
        to get predicted log wing chords for the species at the same log weight, so that we can compare them. These
        predicted log wing chords will be mass-adjusted, <strong>least squares means</strong>.</p>
      <p>To understand what these least squares means represent, let's make a graph that shows them.</p>
      <p>6. This graph will be similar to the one you already made, but this time it will graph the wing.lm ANCOVA model
        - whereas the regression lines in the graph of the data were fairly parallel (because that's how the data are
        distributed), these lines will be exactly parallel (because that's how the model is constructed). We can use the
        emmeans library's emmip() command - this is short for "expected marginal mean interaction plot" - in the <strong>console</strong>
        type<strong></strong>: </p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(emmeans)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmip(wing.lm, Species ~ log.weight, cov.reduce = range)</p>
      <p>Your graph will look like this:</p>
      <img alt="The target" src="ancova_with_lines.png">
      <p>The cov.reduce = range argument causes emmip() to give us a range of log.weights on the x-axis so that we can
        see the lines. </p>
      <p>This graph is fine, but it doesn't show the data points - we should only interpret the model if it fits the
        data well, and plotting the data on the graph helps us confirm that the fit is good. Fortunately, emmip() uses
        ggplot2 for its graphs, and we can add elements to it by just adding them on as though emmip() was the ggplot()
        command. Usually we would be able to just use geom_point() to add them without any arguments, but when emmip() graphs a fitted model the variable names are changed. To get the points onto the graph we just need to specify the data and the x and y variables again in the geom_point() command.</p>
<p>To make the graph, put this command into your <strong>Rmd file</strong> (wing.graph.ancova chunk): </p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmip(wing.lm, Species ~ log.weight, cov.reduce = range) + geom_point(data = hawks, aes(x = log.weight, y = log.wing, color = Species)) +
        geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hawks$log.weight))</p>
      <p>The geom_vline() command adds a vertical line that intersects x-axis at the mean of log.weight. Where this
        vertical line crosses the regression lines for the three species are the least-squares means. Your final graph
        should look like this:</p>
      <img src="lsmeans_wing_graph.png" alt="Final wing graph"><br>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>The Tukey comparisons between these mass-adjusted least-squares means that we will do in the next step will compare the vertical differences between the species lines at the mean of log.weight.</p>
      <p>7. We can get Tukey post-hocs for the differences between mass-adjusted least-squares means using the emmeans
        library (in the wing.tukey chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p><span class="R-code rcmd">emmeans(wing.lm, tukey ~ Species)<br>
        </span></p>
      <p>There are two parts to the output - first there is an $emmeans block that looks like this:&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="rout"> $emmeans<br>
        &nbsp;Species emmean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df lower.CL upper.CL<br>
        &nbsp;CH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.575 0.006082 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.563&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.587<br>
        &nbsp;RT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.778 0.005104 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.768&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.788<br>
        &nbsp;SS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.582 0.010419 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.561&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.602<br>
        <br>
        Confidence level used: 0.95 </p>
      <p>These are the expected marginal means (a.k.a. the least squares means) for log wing span, calculated at the
        mean log weight. Calculating the least squares means at the mean of the covariate is a good choice, because it
        is where the standard errors will typically be smallest. You can see that RT still have the largest wing span
        (5.778) after adjusting for mass, but the difference is much smaller than if we hadn't adjusted them - the RT
        mean slide down its line to the mean log.weight, and both the CH and SS means slid up, which brought the means
        closer together.</p>
      <p>Whether the differences between the species should be interpreted depends on whether the Tukey comparisons are
        significant - those comparisons are in the next block, and look like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">$contrasts<br>

        P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates </p>
      <p>The comparisons reported are between the log weight-adjusted means for log of wing chord for each species.
        Based on these results you'll see that the buteo (RT) is different from the two accipiters (CH and SS), but the
        two accipiters are not different from one another. This isn't too surprising, since the two accipiters look to
        be very similar in shape, but differ in size, such that once the size difference has been accounted for there
        isn't really any difference left between the accipiters.</p>
      <p>8. The choice to get least squares means at the mean of weight is a good one, but is it really the best one?
        The lines are parallel, so the amount of difference between the species will always be the same, but the
        standard errors are not. We can ask for the least squares means at any value of the mean of log.mass that we
        want - the default is to calculate them at the mean of the covariate, so we can get that without specifying the
        value for log.mass (in the wing.lsmeans chunk of your <strong>Rmd file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmeans(wing.lm, ~Species)</p>
      <p>This gives you the same set of least squares means, standard errors, and 95% confidence limits you got with
        your Tukey tests:</p>
      <p class="rout">Species emmean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df lower.CL upper.CL<br>
        &nbsp;CH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.575 0.006082 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.563&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.587<br>

        &nbsp;SS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.582 0.010419 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.561&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.602</p>
      <p>To get the least squares means calculated at a log.weight of 0 we just need to enter (below your first
        emmeans() command, same code chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmeans(wing.lm, ~Species, at = list(log.weight = 0))</p>
      <p>which specifies the log.weight we want to use as the at = argument. The output looks like this:</p>
      <p class="rout">Confidence level used: 0.95 <br>
        &nbsp;Species emmean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df lower.CL upper.CL<br>
        &nbsp;CH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.91 0.0430 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        3.82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.99<br>
        &nbsp;RT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.11 0.0497 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        4.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.21<br>

        3.85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.98</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the means are smaller because we're calculating them at a smaller value of log.mass. The
        differences between the means are all the same, but the standard errors are quite a bit bigger. If we calculated
        them at a log.weight of 10 (a truly frighteningly large hawk of 22 kg, but for the sake of argument):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">emmeans(wing.lm, ~Species, at = list(log.weight = 10))</p>
      <p>This gives you the output:</p>
      <p class="rout">Confidence level used: 0.95 <br>
        &nbsp;Species emmean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SE&nbsp; df lower.CL upper.CL<br>
        &nbsp;CH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.55 0.0289 858&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        6.48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.62</p>
      <p>The amount of difference between the least-squares means is still 0.2 between the accipiters and RT, and around
        0.01 between SS and CH (yeah, I know - emmeans() is rounding a bit too much to see this, but the difference is
        the same). Again, the standard errors are larger than what we get when we estimate the means at the mean of the
        covariate. Regression estimates are most precise close to the mean of the x-data and the mean of the y-data,
        because they are not affected by error in the estimate of the slope there. </p>
      <p>9. Now that you've worked through the analysis for wing chord, repeat the analysis for tail length (variable
        Tail). You will probably need to log-transform Tail, like you did Wing - see the Rmd file for prompts for the
        steps you need to take (make sure you change variable names to reflect that you're using tail length this
        time!). </p>

    <h2 class="part" id="allo_iso">Why not use the easy way?</h2>
    <p>After all of of this effort to make mass-adjusted comparisons between species using ANCOVA, you may be wondering:
      why didn't we standardize the data by just dividing wing chord or tail length by the weight of the bird? This
      would express the data as a set of wing chords per unit mass that would be comparable between the species, so why
      bother with all these ANCOVA, least squares means shenanigans?</p>
    <p>The reason to avoid this method of standardizing for body mass is that it doesn't represent the actual scaling
      relationship well.</p>
    <p>If you divide the mean wing chord by the mean body mass you are calculating the slope of a line - with the change
      in wing chord in the numerator being (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>log.wing</sub> - 0),
      and the change in log mass in the denominator being (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span><sub>log.mass</sub>
      - 0). To use this ratio to predict the mean wing chord of a species from its slope you would multiply the ratio by
      the species' mean log body weight - that is: </p>
    <p>(x̅<sub>log.wing</sub>/x̅<sub>log.weight</sub>) x̅<sub>log.weight</sub> = x̅<sub>log.wing</sub></p>
    <p>We got the right answer without having to add an intercept, which means that the intercept for this relationship
      is zero.</p>
    <p>We could think of standardizing by dividing by log.mass, then, as equivalent to fitting linear models with
      intercepts of 0 and slopes that are mean wing chords divided by mean log body weight for each species, like so:</p>
    <p>CH: log.wing = 0.91 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>RT: log.wing = 0.85 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>SS: log.wing = 1.06 (log.weight)</p>
    <p>Since these ratios are not the same the lines are not parallel. If we use these models to represent the data, we
      would be hypothesizing that the <em>scaling relationship</em> is different between the species, rather than
      hypothesizing a single, common scaling relationship with different <em>intercepts</em>. </p>
    <p>Why would this be a problem? It might not be, it just depends on whether a model with these slopes and an
      intercept of 0 fits the data well.</p>

      <p>The graph on the left shows each of the three equations running through the data - and, as you can see, these
        models don't actually fit the data as well as the ANCOVA did, because the data don't fall along the lines, but
        instead the lines cut through the data at an angle.</p>
      <p>So, the only advantage of the simple approach is that it's simple, but it isn't a very good model for the data.</p>
