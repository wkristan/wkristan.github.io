    <h1>Lab 9 - GIS models and statistical models</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We are going to be building single-species reserves as the project for
      this class, using a GIS modeling approach. Implicitly, we will be assuming
      that anywhere a species' habitat is found, the species will also be found.
      This is not an unreasonable assumption, or at least it is not without
      justification. For example, we know:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Species require suitable habitat to survive and persist</li>
      <li>In the absence of suitable habitat, the species will be absent in the
        long term</li>
      <li>Many animal species are adapted to search for habitat, and plant
        species often have adaptations that increase the chances that they will
        end up in suitable habitat when they disperse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This rationale is the reason that the presence of suitable habitat is
      commonly used as a substitute for actual data on distribution and
      abundance of organisms in conservation planning. Censusing animal
      populations over large areas is often impractical, but environmental
      characteristics, such as vegetation, elevation, and climate, can be
      remotely sensed and mapped over large areas. </p>
    <h2>GIS habitat models</h2>
    <p>We can think of habitat as being a set of environmental conditions that
      have to be met for a particular species to successfully survive and
      reproduce. Each of these conditions can be codified as a separate variable
      (e.g. vegetation type, elevation, rainfall, etc.), and locations on a map
      that meet all of the necessary conditions can then be used as a habitat
      map for the species. To the extent that we expect the find the species in
      its habitat, we can use a habitat map as a map of the predicted
      distribution of the species. This approach forms the basis for much of
      modern conservation planning, and you will use this approach in your lab
      project.</p>
    <p>There are two basic ways of translating habitat information into a
      prediction of the distribution of a species. The first approach is to
      build a GIS model by finding areas on the map that meet all of the
      conditions. You learned last week to do this using vector polygon maps and
      overlay functions (clip, erase, intersection, union). Today we will use
      the raster calculator in Spatial Analyst to build a GIS model based on
      raster data. </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img style="width: 554px; height: 495px; float: left;" alt="" src="gis_model.png">
            <p>For example, if you know that a species occurs at elevations
              above 1000 ft in the Mojave Desert, you could find locations
              within the Mojave that meet this criterion, and use the result as
              a predicted distribution of the species' habitat. An example,
              using just elevation, looks like this map to the left. Areas that
              are at or above 1000 ft are colored red, and this becomes our map
              of predicted habitat for the species.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img style="width: 526px; height: 405px; float: left;" alt="Niche axis"
              src="niche_axis.jpg">
            <p>The weakness of the approach is that all areas that meet the
              condition are treated as equally good habitat, which is probably
              not true. If you recall from the ecology review we did at the
              beginning of class, we expect that a species will respond to a
              gradient in its environment, such as water temperature, like the
              illustration to the left. The x-axis is temperature, and the
              y-axis is population size - the black curve shows the expected
              population size of this fish species as temperature changes (I
              know there aren't a lot of fish in the Mojave, but this is the
              best illustration of the point I could find. Work with me). At
              very low temperatures the species is unable to survive, and it
              should be absent. As the temperature increases, it gets just warm
              enough for the species to survive - this is the lower limit of
              tolerance. As the temperature continues to increase, we should
              find increasingly dense populations of the fish until we reach the
              best temperature for their survival and reproduction, where
              abundance peaks. Above this peak the temperature gets too warm,
              the abundance declines. Eventually the upper limit of tolerance is
              reached, and the fish is unable to survival because the water is
              too warm.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>So, given this pattern, we can expect that the species will be abundant
      where habitat conditions are good, rare where conditions are marginal, and
      absent where conditions are unsuitable. As a species becomes increasingly
      uncommon it becomes more likely that we won't see it if we go looking. If
      we are sampling the environment for this fish by dropping nets into the
      water and hauling up a catch, we would expect to consistently catch them
      from water near the optimum temperature, but we will often miss them
      entirely in water that has marginal temperature conditions. In other
      words, you can interpret "Few organisms" on the graph as "only sometimes
      present in samples at this temperature".</p>
    <p>There is an additional issue that isn't illustrated in this simple,
      single-variable GIS model. Habitat is multidimensional, and since
      organism's habitat is usually defined by more than one variable, habitat
      models are thus usually based on more than one variable as well. For
      example, if we were working with a species that occurs above 1000 ft and
      in areas with precipitation greater than 40 mm, we would use an elevation
      layer and a precipitation layer, and every pixel that was both above 1000
      ft and had precipitation greater than 40 mm would be identified as habitat
      for the species. When we build a GIS habitat model, each of the criteria
      we use is treated as equally important, but this is probably very rarely
      true. In this example precipitation may be really important to the
      species, and elevation may be less important, but there isn't any way to
      represent this difference in a binary, yes/no GIS model. </p>
    <h2>Statistical habitat models, applied to maps</h2>
    <p>The second approach to predicting distributions is to 1) develop a
      statistical model that relates the occurrence of a species to
      environmental attributes found at a sample of locations, and then 2) use
      the model to predict where the species should be across an entire region.
      Exactly what is predicted depends on the statistical model used - a linear
      regression might be used to predict abundance, and a <strong>logistic
        regression</strong> might be used to predict the probability of the
      organism's presence at a site.</p>
    <p>Logistic regression is popular for this kind of work because it predicts
      probability of occurrence, and probabilities can be used as a measure of
      intensity of use. A probability of 0.8 is interpretable as an 80% chance
      of finding the organism at a site, or equivalently, 80% of sites with
      habitat characteristics like those found at the site would contain the
      species. </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img style="width: 448px; height: 291px; float: left;" alt="" src="strong_logistic.png">
            <p>Logistic regression also allows us to deal with cases in which we
              have strong associations with some habitat variables, and weaker
              associations with others. The graphs to the left shows a
              hypothetical set of locations that were sampled along an
              elevational gradient; each red diamond is a different sample, and
              places where this organism was found were assigned a 1, and places
              where the organism was not found was assigned a 0. </p>
            <p>This graph is called "strong relationship" because the line that
              represents the statistical relationship between elevation and
              probability of occurrence shows a steep transition from very high
              probability of presence at low elevations, to a very low
              probability of occurrence at high elevations. There is a narrow
              range of elevations, between about 900 to 1100 ft, where the
              species could either be present or absent, but there are no
              absences below 800 feet and no presences above 1400 ft.<br>
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img style="width: 448px; height: 291px; float: left;" alt="" src="weak_logistic.png">
            <p>Compare the strong relationship above to this graph of a weaker
              relationship. In this graph the species is present across nearly
              the entire elevational range, but it is present with a greater
              probability at low elevation than at high elevation. The s-shaped
              curve that characterizes the statistical relationship between
              elevation and probability of occurrence is less steep, and doesn't
              asymptote at 1 or 0 like it did for the strong relationship. Both
              curves show an inflection point at 1000 ft, where the curves cross
              over a probability of occurrence of 0.5.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>What does this mean in terms of use of habitat by the species? In both
      cases the species is using the habitat non-randomly - it is selecting
      habitat at low elevation. A species that used elevation at random would
      have a flat line, at whatever proportion of the sites the organism
      occupied overall (that is, if it was found at half the sites, it would be
      a flat line at a probability of occurrence of 0.5). However, with the
      strong relationship we are nearly guaranteed to see the species at sea
      level, and very unlikely to see it at 2000 feet. With the weaker
      relationship we have about a 95% chance of seeing the species at sea
      level, and a 5% chance of seeing it at 2000 feet. The weaker relationship
      suggests a that the species tolerates a fairly wide range of variation in
      elevation.</p>
    <p>This statistical approach addresses some of the disadvantages of the GIS
      model. For example, differences in the predicted probability of occurrence
      of a species can be interpreted as differences in habitat suitability,
      i.e. habitat in which the species is always found (probability of
      occurrence near 1.0) will be considered better habitat than one in which
      the species is only found 75% of the time (probability of occurrence at
      0.75). Additionally, as a built-in part of the statistical modeling,
      variables that have only a small effect on probability of occurrence will
      be weighted less than variables that have a large effect.</p>
    <h2>Uncertainty in predicted habitat</h2>
    <p>The GIS model above isn't based on probability, so we can think of the
      GIS model as a definite prediction of presence or absence for a species,
      with no uncertainty represented in the prediction. There is no easy way to
      tell from the GIS model which habitat is best for the species and which is
      only marginal, so it's difficult to know how likely we are to actually see
      the species when we go to a spot on the map that predicts its presence.
      For example, what if we went out in the field and surveyed for the species
      and only found it present in 50% of the sites we sampled? This could be a
      cause for alarm, if we sampled in high-quality habitat, but it could be
      exactly as expected if it turns out we had sampled in areas that were only
      marginally suitable.</p>
    <p>Logistic regression models give us a more refined prediction, and we can
      use the predicted probabilities of presence to help us interpret our field
      data. If the species had a strong relationship with habitat, and the model
      predicted a 99.9% chance of a species being present, then if we only found
      the species in 50% of our samples, we could conclude either that the model
      was wrong, or that the species might be suffering a decline. If we were
      sampling in habitat that only had a 50% of containing the species, then
      finding them only 50% of the time would not be a cause for concern.</p>
    <p>Today we will build a GIS model, and equivalent logistic regression
      models (one representing a strong relationship with habitat, one
      representing a weak relationship), and we will compare the information we
      can derive from each.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 1 - A GIS model of predicted occurrence</h2>
    <p>You will find the data you need in the Lab9_data folder on the P: drive.
      We will be using data on elevation, January temperature, winter
      precipitation, and summer precipitation to predict the distribution of a
      hypothetical Mojave Desert species. The species is a low-elevation, dry
      habitat specialist that does not tolerate frost. To translate this into a
      GIS model, we will use the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The species is found at elevations below 1000 feet.</li>
      <li>It is found in places with average January low temperatures greater
        than 0 degrees C.</li>
      <li>It is found in places with summer precipitation less than 40 mm</li>
      <li>It is found in places with winter precipitation less than 100 mm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the data sets you have are raster files, so you can use the raster
      calculator to derive the model in one step.</p>
    <p>1. Add the files "elevation", "ppt_summer", "ppt_winter", and "temp_jan"
      to your project.</p>
    <p>2. You may need to turn on the Spatial Analyst extension (Customize →
      Extensions, then make sure the box is checked next to Spatial Analyst).</p>
    <p>In the ArcToolbox find Spatial Analyst Tools → Map Algebra → Raster
      Calculator, and launch it. Bear in mind that the Raster Calculator is VERY
      FUSSY about format. The safest way to build your model is to use the
      calculator buttons. If you do choose to type commands, make sure you put
      spaces, quotes, and parentheses where they are needed.</p>
    <p>In the raster calculator, build the following expression (including the
      parentheses around each comparison):</p>
    <p>("elevation" &lt; 1000) &amp; ("ppt_summer" &lt; 40) &amp; ("ppt_winter"
      &lt; 100) &amp; ("temp_jan" &gt; 0)</p>
    <p>Set the output map to "gis_model" in your lab9 folder (on the S: drive).
    </p>
    <p>Although we are using a calculator, all of the operations are "boolean",
      meaning they all evaluate as "TRUE" or "FALSE". Each of these statements
      in parentheses use a comparison operator (either a &lt; or a &gt;), and
      will evaluate as TRUE if a pixel meets the condition, and FALSE if it does
      not. The ampersand character (&amp;) means "And". "And" operations are
      only true if all parts are true, so linking a string of comparisons
      together with &amp; only results in a TRUE every one of the conditions are
      TRUE. If any of the conditions are FALSE, the entire statement is FALSE.
      This is why all of the variables are considered equally weighted in a GIS
      model, because each variable has a "veto power" over the rest. Click "OK"
      to run the raster calculator. </p>
    <p>The map should look like <a href="gis_model1.png"> this</a> (although
      hopefully with better colors). The green areas are 1's (which to a
      computer is the value for "TRUE"), which indicate the elevation, January
      temperature, and winter and summer precipitation criteria are all
      satisfied. The purple areas are 0's (which to a computer is the value for
      "FALSE"), which indicates at least one of the conditions were not
      satisfied.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 2 - Predicting occurrence with logistic regression equations</h2>
    <p>To illustrate the difference between GIS models and statistical models,
      we will be using the results from a logistic regression, which I will
      provide you, to predict the probability that our organism will occur
      within a pixel given our four habitat variables. The lines in the figures
      in the introduction are based on a single variable, and are generated with
      the following equation:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 129px; height: 49px;" alt="" src="log_model_simple.gif"
        name="Object3" hspace="8"></p>
    <p>Look for a minute at how this equation works. In the exponents of the
      base e, there is a straight line equation (m is the slope, which here
      indicates the strength of the relationship with elevation, and b is the
      intercept that positions the curve along the x-axis).&nbsp;The straight
      line equation in the exponents can predict either positive or negative
      numbers. As you know, negative numbers in an exponent make the number
      approach zero (remember, e<sup>-x</sup> is the same as 1/e<sup>x</sup> ...
      as X gets infinitely large 1/e<sup>x</sup> gets infinitely small).&nbsp;
      When the straight line part predicts large negative numbers the
      exponentials&nbsp;approaches zero, and the equation predicts p = 0/(1+0) =
      0. Big positive numbers predicted by the straight line part make the
      exponentials very big. When the straight line part is very big the
      exponential parts in the numerator and denominator dominate the
      prediction, and the 1 in the denominator becomes increasingly unimportant
      to the predicted probability. For example, if the exponential parts of the
      equation equal 1000, then the predicted probability of occurrence will be
      1000/(1+1000) = 0.999. When the straight line parts predict a value of 0,
      then the exponentials become e<sup>0</sup>, which equals 1; the model then
      predicts p = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which is the "inflection point" at which the
      shape of the curve goes from increasing to decreasing.</p>
    <p>Another form of this equation is less easy to understand, but is easier
      to compute:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 144px; height: 41px;" alt="" src="log_model_simple1.gif"></p>
    <p>This is the form we'll be using to make our predictions.</p>
    <p>A nice feature of logistic regression (and of linear regression too) is
      that you can add additional predictors by adding a slope multiplied by the
      variable to the straight line part in the exponent, like so:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 330px; height: 41px;" alt="" src="log_model.gif"></p>
    <p><br>
      Here the straight line part in the exponent of the denominator still has a
      single intercept, but has slopes for each of the variables included.
      Although this looks complicated, it is really just a simple extension of
      the first equation, and works the same way. </p>
    <p>The slopes allow the variables to be weighted differently - a slope near
      zero will cause the variable to have very little effect on the predicted
      probability of occurrence, whereas a large slope will cause the variable
      to have a big effect. Positive slopes mean that the probability of
      occurrence increases as the variable increases, and negative slopes mean
      the probability of occurrence decreases as the variable increases. Bear in
      mind, though, that the slopes also adjust for differences in measurement
      scale, so it's not easy to compare slopes between variables to figure out
      which is most heavily weighted (for example, elevations range across
      thousands of feet, while temperatures range across a few tens of degrees -
      even if temperature and elevation are equally important to the species the
      elevation slope will be smaller than the temperature slope because of this
      difference in range). We would need to look at "standardized"
      coefficients, which account for differences in measurement scale, to
      compare among variables. For our purposes today, the important thing is
      that using this approach allows the variables to have different degrees of
      effect on probability of occurrence.</p>
    <p>Because the equation is a little awkward to work with we will be doing
      our predictions in two stages to prevent errors, and make them easier to
      detect if they do occur. In the <b>first stage</b>, you will create a map
      with the straight line part of the equation, which is:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 443px; height: 27px;" alt="" src="logit.gif" name="Object5"
        hspace="8"></p>
    <p>and the <b>second stage</b> will take the straight line predictions and
      plug them into the exponential function (which is e<sup>-y</sup>), and
      predict probability of occurrence:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 79px; height: 41px;" alt="" src="eqnt_html_17848238.gif"></p>
    <p><br>
      Simple, no?</p>
    <h4>First stage calculation: </h4>
    <p>We will use the following values for the "parameters" (the intercept and
      slopes):</p>
    <p>b = 17.848434</p>
    <p>m<sub>1</sub> = -0.000787<br>
    </p>
    <p>m<sub>2</sub> = 2.24148</p>
    <p>m<sub>3</sub> = -0.171888</p>
    <p>m<sub>4</sub> = -0.118149</p>
    <p>Open of the "Raster Calculator", and build the equation...</p>
    <p>17.848434 -&nbsp;0.000787 * "elevation" +&nbsp;2.24148 * "temp_jan"
      -&nbsp;0.171888 * "ppt_winter" - 0.118149 * "ppt_summer"</p>
    <p>you can accept the default output location (we don't need to save this
      file, it's just a calculation step), but call it "stage1". If all goes
      well this will give you a new layer that ranges from -123.699 and 15.0314.
    </p>
    <p><i>Question: Do the signs on the slopes agree with the habitat
        description for this species?</i> </p>
    <p><a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('signs_correct')">Click here
        to see if you're right.</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <div style="display:none;" id="signs_correct">
      <p style="border-style:solid;padding:10px;">Positive signs mean a positive
        relationship (as the variable increases the probability of occurrence
        increases too), negative signs mean a negative relationship (as the
        variable increases the probability of occurrence decreases). The species
        likes low elevation (negative), high temps in January (positive), low
        winter and low summer precipitation (negative).</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Second stage calculation</h4>
    <p>Open the raster calculator again, and build the following statement:</p>
    <p>1 / (1 + Exp( - "stage1"))</p>
    <p>and call the output "strong_hab" (and place this in your lab8 folder).
      Watch the negative before "stage1", you won't get the right answer without
      it. The resulting map should have continuous numbers that fall between 0
      and 1.</p>
    <h4>Predicted presence from probabilities</h4>
    <p>Although ultimately we might prefer the logistic regression-based model
      to our original GIS model, it would be nice to compare their predictions.
      We can't convert the GIS model to predicted probabilities, but we can
      convert our probabilities to predicted presences. To do this, all we need
      to do is to assign any predicted probability greater than 0.5 to a
      predicted presence (1), and any predicted probability less than 0.5 to a
      predicted absence (0). You can do this with the raster calculator with the
      expression:</p>
    <p>"strong_hab" &gt; 0.5<br clear="left">
      <br>
      Call the output file "strong_pres" (short for strong habitat, predicted
      presence). </p>
    <p>Why does this expression work? When we compare one value to another using
      a comparison operator (such as =, &gt;, &lt;) we will either get a value
      of "True" or "False". To a computer, "True" is equal to 1, and "False" is
      equal to 0. We can take advantage of this behavior to round our predicted
      probabilities to 1 and 0, which we can then use as a map of predicted
      presence and absence.</p>
    <h4>Repeat for a weaker habitat association</h4>
    <p>What if the habitat association was weaker? Repeat the first stage
      calculations using the following coefficients:</p>
    <p>b =&nbsp;8.924217</p>
    <p>m<sub>1</sub> =&nbsp;-0.0003935</p>
    <p>m<sub>2</sub> =&nbsp;1.12074</p>
    <p>m<sub>3</sub> =&nbsp;-0.085944</p>
    <p>m<sub>4</sub> =&nbsp;-0.0590745</p>
    <p>These are all 1/2 the value of the previous ones, which results in a
      shallower curve that doesn't approach 0 or 1 rapidly. Use them to build
      the expression:</p>
    <p>8.924217&nbsp;-&nbsp;0.0003935 * "elevation" +&nbsp;1.12074 * "temp_jan"
      -&nbsp;0.085944 * "ppt_winter" -&nbsp;0.0590745 * "ppt_summer" </p>
    <p>for the first stage calculation (call it "stage1_w" for the stage 1
      calculation, weak habitat relationship). </p>
    <p>Now, repeat the second stage calculation using stage1_w instead of
      stage1, and save the resulting probability map as&nbsp;"weak_hab". </p>
    <p>Predict presence and absence in the raster calculator using the
      expression "weak_hab &gt; 0.5", and call the resulting presence/absence
      prediction map "weak_pres".</p>
    <p>Now, it would be nice to be able to compare the weak habitat model to the
      strong, but both are raster layers, and we can only look at one at a time.
      Also, ArcMap scales the shades of gray to the numbers in the raster layer,
      which makes the comparison more difficult - if they both used the same
      color for the same probabilities it would be easier to see how they
      compare. We'll fix the second problem first.</p>
    <p>Double-click on weak_hab and switch to the "Symbology" tab. The layer
      will have had a "Stretched" grayscale color ramp assigned to it, which is
      okay but we want it to use the stretched grayscale ramp of the strong
      habitat layer instead (we'll assign the strong to the weak rather than the
      other way around because the strong covers a slightly wider range of
      values). Click on the "Open file" (folder) button, and select the
      "strong_hab" layer as the color ramp to import, and click "OK". The color
      ramps are now the same between the layers, which means a shade of gray
      means the same thing in both strong_hab and weak_hab.</p>
    <p>Next, we want to be able to compare the layers more easily. We can't
      display both at once, but we can "swipe" one, which will reveal the other
      one. Select "Windows" → "Image analysis". In the list of layers, turn off
      everything except weak_hab and strong_hab. Click on weak_hab to select it,
      and then find the "Swipe layer" button, which is just above the
      "Processing" area (it looks like <a href="swipe.jpg">this</a>). If you
      then click someplace over the map, you will see the weak_hab layer is
      removed above your mouse, showing the strong_hab layer. You can click,
      hold, and move your mouse to swipe away the weak_hab wherever you want, so
      that you can compare the two layers more easily. You'll see that the only
      difference between them is that the weak habitat association shows less
      contrast (more shades of gray) than the strong habitat association, but
      they both should show the same transition from probabilities less than 0.5
      and greater than 0.5 occurs. Thus, the change is much like the change from
      the strong relationship and the weak relationship illustrated in the
      figures at the beginning of the handout.</p>
    <p>You can also compare the strong_pres to weak_pres. As you change between
      them you'll see color change, but the distribution of the 1's and 0's
      should be almost identical between them. If you compare either of them to
      the gis_model map, you'll see only minor differences between them. All
      three are representing the same habitat association.</p>
    <p>We will compare the maps in the next exercise.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 3 - Differences between GIS predictions and strong or weak
      statistical models</h2>
    <p>You now have predicted distributions from a GIS model, and one strong
      statistical model and a weak statistical model. How do they compare?</p>
    <p>To explore this question, we will be subtracting the different
      predictions from one another and comparing the results. For example, to
      subtract the GIS model predictions from the predicted presence in based on
      the strong habitat model, you would use the expression:</p>
    <p>("strong_pres") - ("gis_model")</p>
    <p>Call the output "st_pres_gis". Repeat this procedure, substituting
      weak_pres for strong_pres (output should be wk_pres_gis).</p>
    <p>The resulting maps should contain only three possible values: -1, 0, and
      1. Places where the GIS model makes the same prediction as the statistical
      model (i.e. the models "agree") you will have a 0. Places in which the
      statistical model predicts presence and the GIS model predicts absence you
      will have a 1, and places in which the statistical model predicts absence
      and the GIS model predicts presence you will have a -1. The GIS model
      should be similar to each of the statistical models, and you should have
      primarily zeros (they would be identical if your instructor was more
      clever, but I got them as close as I could).</p>
    <p>How do the two statistical models compare? Subtract "strong_pres" from
      "weak_pres." Lacking any rounding error they should be identical, but you
      will probably see a few non-zero pixels.</p>
    <h3>GIS habitat models - no uncertainty represented, does that mean complete
      certainty?</h3>
    <p>So, we now have probabilities of occurrence from the strong and weak
      habitat models, as well as the GIS model predictions, and the
      presence/absence versions of the strong and weak habitat models. A GIS
      model, or a predicted presence/absence obtained from the probability
      calculations, gives a uniform prediction of presence, with no uncertainty
      represented. The logistic regression habitat models intrinsically
      represent uncertainty, in the sense that a predicted probability of
      occurrence of, for example, 0.75 tells us that we should expect 75% of
      habitats like the habitat in the pixel to have the species present, and in
      25% the species would be absent.</p>
    <p>This becomes an issue in a couple of contexts. First is the "my favorite
      pixel" problem. If you present a GIS map of habitat to someone who knows
      the area that is mapped, they will point at a pixel on the map and say
      "Your map says the species is absent here, but I saw it there just last
      week". A predicted absence can mean the species is expected to be present
      as much as 49% of the time, so this isn't necessarily a prediction
      failure, it just appears to be one. The second problem is that it's really
      important to validate a model by collecting new data and comparing the
      model predictions to the data. A presence/absence map will only ever be
      correct or incorrect, but in areas where the probability of occurrence is
      0.51 you expect the species to be absent 49% of the time. Every time an
      area that is predicted to contain the species does not, it will be scored
      as a "commission error" - a predicted presence that is wrong. Large rates
      of commission error are a strike against the habitat model, and it may
      lead to the impression that the habitat model is incorrect. However, if
      the actual probability of presence is 0.51, the model is only predicting
      badly if either the species is present at a much higher rate or a much
      lower rate than 51% of the samples. Using a probability-based habitat map
      allows you to get a much more precise idea of the predictive accuracy of
      the model, and can prevent you from throwing out a perfectly good habitat
      model.</p>
    <p>So, the question we will address now is, how much uncertainty in
      predicted presence and absence is the habitat model obscuring?</p>
    <p>To answer this question, use the Raster Calculator to subtract the
      predicted presence for the strong model from the predicted probabilities
      (that is: ("strong_pres") - ("strong_hab") ). Remember, the strong_pres
      map is supposed to match the GIS habitat model exactly, but since they
      aren't perfect matches we'll use the strong_pres map to compare against
      the probabilities. That way we can just focus on the uncertainty that
      comes from predicting presence/absence from a set of probabilities,
      without having to account for the slight differences between the GIS map
      and the statistical presence/absence maps. </p>
    <p>The map will look something like this:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 460px; height: 429px;" alt="" src="accuracy_strong.png"></p>
    <p>The values will range from -0.49 to +0.49, with black indicating negative
      and white indicating positive differences. Since we subtracted the
      probabilities from the presence/absences, positives will be places that
      were predicted present (1 - a probability), whereas blacks will be places
      that were predicted absences (0 - a probability). The closer to white or
      black, the greater the amount of prediction error we can expect. Places
      that have a predicted "absence" (that is, those that were rounded down to
      0) can be different from the predicted probability by as much as -0.5, and
      places with a predicted "presence" (that is, those that were rounded up to
      1) can be different from the predicted probability by as much as 0.5.
      These are places where the presence of the species is maximally
      unpredictable - whether the species will occur or not is the toss of a
      coin.</p>
    <p>Repeat this calculation with "weak_pres" and "weak_hab" (that is:
      ("weak_pres") - ("weak_hab") ). How do the differences compare between the
      map of the strong relationship and the map of the weak relationship? Do
      you see a greater amount of nearly white or nearly black pixels? This
      would indicate a greater amount of uncertainty in our predictions of
      presence or absence.</p>
    <p>So, bear in mind: when we predict the presence of a species based on its
      habitat needs, even if we understand the habitat associations well, we can
      expect to sometimes fail to see them where they're predicted to occur, or
      to see them where they are not predicted to occur. Locations that have
      close to a 50% chance of occurrence are the most uncertain, and if the
      habitat association is weak there may be a lot of area on the map that
      gives only a moderate chance of the species being present. GIS maps aren't
      immune from this uncertainty, but the way they are constructed doesn't
      give us a way to assess our relative confidence in our predictions.</p>
