    <h1>ArcMap tutorial.</h1>
    <p>This tutorial will help you learn the basics of using GIS software. GIS
      stands for "geographic information systems", which is a general term for
      software that manages map-based data - that is, any data that has a
      position in two or three dimensional space. There are several GIS software
      packages used today, including some that are open source (and thus free of
      charge), but the ArcGIS package is by far the most commonly used, and the
      one you are most likely to encounter in the real world. ArcGIS is produced
      by ESRI, which stands for Environmental Systems Research Institute. ESRI
      has been developing their ArcGIS software in various forms since the mid-
      1970's, and it has become the "industry standard", much like the Microsoft
      Office is for office software. For example, if you apply for a job in
      resource planning, environmental consulting, or some other related field,
      you will likely see "Experience with ArcGIS" listed as a requirement,
      rather than just "GIS experience", much like you may see "Experience with
      Excel" instead of "Experience with spreadsheets".</p>
    <p>ArcMap is the mapping and spatial data analysis part of ESRI's ArcGIS,
      and is the primary component of ArcGIS that we will use in this class. We
      will concentrate on some of the basic the mechanics of using the software
      today (e.g. adding and removing files from projects, changing color
      schemes and labels, etc.).</p>
    <p>The tutorial is divided into three lessons, each with its own example
      data set. Data files that are used by everyone for lab exercises will be
      kept on the "Public" network drive, which is called "Public on Viking
      (P:)" by Windows. You will not need to download copies of these files to
      use them.</p>
    <h2>Running ArcMap though cougarapps</h2>
    <p> As you may know, CSUSM now makes much of the software you use in classes
      available for use both on campus and from home through the "cougarapps"
      interface. When you run a program like ArcMap through cougarapps, you are
      actually running it on one of the university's computers in another
      building, and only the graphical interface is being displayed on the
      screen of the computer you are using. This has some advantages (such as
      making files on your H: drive available from home, and giving you access
      to an extremely expensive program for free without having to deal with
      student licensing issues), but we have had some trouble running ArcMap
      through cougarapps, including very slow operation and frequent crashes.
      Our computer tech support people have addressed the problems by making a
      "virtual" instance of Windows for each student running ArcMap, complete
      with space for you to temporarily store files that you create. The good
      news is that this has in fact solved most of our problems, but the bad
      news is that running ArcMap will be a little more complicated than running
      other programs through cougarapps.</p>
    <p>So, when you select the "Start" menu in Windows, and start "ArcMap", you
      will get an entire Windows desktop in a window inside of your current
      Windows desktop. You will then need to use the Start menu in this new
      desktop window to start ArcMap - if you don't see it right away, type
      "Arcmap" in the search bar of the Start menu, and select it from the list.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - Basic map display.</h2>
    <p>Initially, ArcMap prompts you with a window that looks like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><img alt="Page size" src="page_size_dialog.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The various page sizes refer to standard sizes of printed maps. We won't
      be doing much printing of hard copies for quite awhile, so we don't need
      to select a page size - click "Cancel". The ArcMap window will look like
      this:</p>
    <p><img alt="ArcMap window" src="arcmap_window.png"></p>
    <p>The parts of the window labeled on the image above are:</p>
    <p><b>Menu bar:</b> the menu system.</p>
    <p><strong>Toolbars</strong>: tools that are frequently used are displayed.
      Toolbars can be re-arranged by clicking, holding, and dragging them by the
      vertical dots on the left side of each toolbar - they can be detached and
      become free-floating windows, and they can be "docked" by dragging them to
      a side of the ArcMap window and dropped there. By default, you will see
      the standard toolbar, and the tools toolbar. Additional toolbars are
      available through the "Customize" menu, but we'll stick with the default
      toolbars for now.</p>
    <p><b>Table of contents</b>: the area where all of the map layers currently
      being displayed will be listed (currently blank). The table of contents is
      the place that you will interact with the map layers to change their
      settings on the map - for example, you can set the plot symbols, colors,
      and other display characteristics for a map layer via its listing in the
      table of contents.</p>
    <p><b>Data Frame</b>: the data frame is the workspace you are using. When
      you start ArcMap you will be given an empty workspace, indicated by the
      "Layers" label in the left-hand panel of the ArcMap window. You can add
      additional data frames to the table of contents with different settings so
      that you can display different maps, with different settings. When you add
      map layers to ArcMap for display, they will be placed into the Table of
      Contents underneath the data frame. </p>
    <p><strong>Position of pointer</strong>: As you move your pointer around the
      map display window, you'll see that the numbers shown at the bottom right
      side of the window change to indicate the position of the pointer.
      Currently, we don't have any map data loaded, so ArcMap doesn't know what
      coordinates to use to indicate position, so the position display is
      showing an arbitrary coordinate system with "Unknown Units" to indicate
      position. As soon as a map layer is added to the map, this display will
      start to use the units of the map layer to indicate position.</p>
    <h3>Getting help</h3>
    <p>In principle, everything you need to know to complete your assignments
      will be in these online instructions. However, ArcMap also provides help
      in various ways that you can take advantage of.</p>
    <p><b>Tool tips</b>: Much of the graphical interface for ArcMap is made up
      of buttons. Once you know what the buttons are for you'll find this
      convenient, but until then you will spend a lot of time hunting for the
      right one. To help you find the right button, the name of each button is
      revealed if you hover your pointer over the button for a few seconds, like
      this:</p>
    <p><img alt="Tooltip" src="tooltip.png"><br clear="left">
      More extensive help is available through the Help menu. The ArcGIS Desktop
      Help menu option starts the ArgGIS help system, which can be searched and
      browsed for help on the topic you want.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Add data to your map</h3>
    <p>Now, add a map layer to the view. Click on the "Add data" button (shown
      above). When you do this, the "find file" dialog will pop up, but the
      location of our files is not yet identified, like this:</p>
    <p><img src="arcmap_map_to_pub.jpg" style="width: 495px; height: 325px;" alt="map pub"></p>
    <p>An odd feature of ArcGIS software is that it doesn't automatically
      present the entire file system that's available in Windows, such as the P:
      drive (P: is a "public" network drive that professors can use to post
      files for use in classes - it's like the H: drive, except that students
      can only read files from it, but can't write to it). We have to "connect"
      the P: drive where the data for this tutorial are held. Click on the
      "connect to folder" icon (upper middle of the dialog, with a yellow
      right-pointing arrow, underlined in red in this picture), which will open
      up the Connect to Folder window. Within the Connect to Folder window, open
      up "Computer", open up "Public on Viking (P:)" and then navigate down to
      "Biology → kristanw → biol533", like so:</p>
    <p><img src="arcmap_map_pub.jpg" alt="map pub"></p>
    <p>Click on the biol533 folder once to select it, and then click "OK". This
      will put you back in the "Add Data" window, open to
      P:\Biology\kristanw\biol533, like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="Connected to P:" src="folder_connected.png"></p>
    <p>You can now go find the files you need - go to "lab1_data" → "lesson01",
      and add the file "30x30.shp" to your map. The 30x30.shp shape file
      contains a 30° grid of the surface of the earth that will be used as the
      background for your map. When you first display it, it will look like
      this: </p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_m963d38f.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; width: 606px; height: 426px;"
        alt="Display grid" name="graphics4" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The coordinates that make up the grid are degrees latitude (which run
      from the equator north and south) and degrees longitude (which run through
      Greenwich, England, and run east and west).<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">STOP! GO NO FURTHER UNTIL
          YOU SAVE YOUR WORK!</span> </p>
      <p>ArcMap is not known for its rock-solid stability, and running it
        through Cougar Apps adds network issues to the list of things that can
        cause it to crash. Get into the habit of saving your work frequently.
        Unfortunately, there is some complexity you need to be aware of to back
        up your work properly.</p>
      <h3>The environment you're working in</h3>
      <p>First, recall that when you start up ArcMap, a virtual Windows desktop
        is started, with its own virtual C: drive. A single computer over in
        IITS is running all of the virtual desktops for everyone in class, with
        a different virtual C: drive for each user. The environment is created
        on the fly when you launch ArcMAP, and it will go away when you log out
        of the virtual Windows desktop.</p>
      <p>We need to run this way to avoid ArcMap crashes. But, it means that
        when you save files, you need to be clear about what you're doing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you save a file from within the Windows virtual desktop
          environment (the one running ArcMap), C: will pertain to the virtual
          drive that will vanish when you log off. </li>
        <li>If you are outside of the virtual desktop, in the Windows desktop
          for the computer at which you are working, then C: pertains to the
          hard drive in the computer. It's a physical drive, and it's still
          there if you log off and log back in.</li>
        <li>All of the other drive letters (H:, P:, S:) are the same in either
          the virtual Windows environment, or the desktop of the computer you're
          working on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To make things work as well as possible, you will need to save files
        into the C: drive of the virtual environment. But, since it vanishes
        when you log off, you will need to then <strong>back these files up to
          your S: drive before you log out!</strong> If you don't you will lose
        your work.</p>
      <h3>ArcGIS map files and data layers</h3>
      <p>The next bit of complexity is that you need to understand what the
        various GIS files are. First, understand that there is a difference
        between map files and data layers.</p>
      <p><strong>Map file</strong> - a file that records the state of the ArcMap
        environment you are working in. This includes the toolbars you are using
        and how they are arranged, the data layers in the table of contents and
        all of their settings (plot symbol, color, etc.). Saving this file
        allows you to start again at the place you left off.</p>
      <p><strong>Data layers</strong> - the GIS data, which you load into the
        Table of Contents. These include shapefiles (like 30x30.shp), and other
        kinds of map data and tables that ArcMap is able to work with.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that saving a map file does not save the data layers! The
        map file only has pointers to where the files are stored, but the map
        data is not actually saved within the map file. Because of this, if you
        were to take the map file to a different computer and open it up on a
        computer that doesn't have access to the P: drive it would not be able
        to find the 30x30.shp file, and would display an error in your Table of
        Contents.</p>
      <p>But, as long as we are using the map file in an environment that can
        access the 30x30.shp data layer on the P: drive, saving the map file
        helps us. To save the map file to the virtual C: drive, do the
        following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on the "Save" icon (the little floppy disk, if you remember
          those, or select "File" → "Save" from the menu.</li>
        <li>Navigate to Computer → Local Disk (C:) → Users → {folder with your
          user name}, and then create a new folder called Biol533, and another
          within it called Lab1. Save your map file within this new Lab1 folder,
          and call it "lab1_map" - this will create a file called lab1_map.mxd.
          Your map file, lab1_map.mxd, is now saved to the virtual C: drive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need to back up this map file to your S: drive before you log
        off so it doesn't disappear when the virtual C: drive disappears, but
        for now your work is saved.</p>
      <h3>ArcGIS shape files</h3>
      <p>There are many different types of GIS data files, of which we will only
        work with a few. Any time we are working with vector data (that is, maps
        that are made up of points, lines, or polygons), we will be working with
        shape files. The name "shape file" is a little confusing, because it
        gives the impression that it is a single file on disk. ArcGIS reinforces
        this impression by only showing you a single file when you are adding
        data layers to the table of contents - for example, when you added
        30x30.shp you only saw a single file named 30x30, with a .shp filename
        extension. This gives the impression that the shape file is a single
        file with a .shp extension.</p>
      <p>In fact, every "shape file" is actually made up of several different
        files that all have the same file name, but with different file
        extensions. ArcMap hides this complexity from us, and only shows us the
        .shp file for the data layers. For those of you that are from the Mac
        world and are unfamiliar with the concept of filename extensions,
        Windows files have a name (just like Mac files do), followed by a period
        (or a "dot"), followed by a filename extension that indicates the type
        of file. When you double-click on the file, Windows uses the filename
        extension to decide what kind of file it is, and uses a table it keeps
        of default programs to use for files with various filename extensions to
        open the file. Macs don't use filename extensions, they use information
        that's written into the file itself to identify the file type instead.
        In both operating systems, two files can't have the same name within the
        same folder, but in Windows having different filename extensions is
        enough to consider the names different. So, ArcGIS is able to keep track
        of which collection of files are part of a "shape file" by using the
        same file name, but with different extensions for all of the component
        files.</p>
      <p>To see what the 30x30 shapefile really looks like, start up Windows
        Explorer, <img alt="Explorer" src="windows_explorer.png">, and navigate
        to "Public on Viking (P:)" → "Biology" → "kristan2" → "biol533" →
        "lab1_data" → "lesson01". You'll see that there are actually several
        files with the same name of 30x30, but with different file name
        extensions. They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30x30.dbf - the attribute table, which is a table of properties
          (called <strong>attributes</strong> by ArcGIS) for each of the
          geometric shapes in the file. Note that Windows by default hides the
          filename extensions for files it knows already. The first file seems
          not to have any extension, but if you look at the "Type" column you'll
          see that Windows thinks this is an "OpenOffice.org 1...." file. This
          is because dbf is an old format that was developed long ago for the
          DBase database program (the program is dead, but the database file
          format lives on). The OpenOffice.org software is set as the default
          software for opening dbf database files, so Windows thinks the
          30x30.dbf file is an OpenOffice.org file. If you want to actually see
          the .dbf extension, you can select "Organize" → "Folder and search
          options", then switch to the "View" tab, and un-check "Hide extensions
          for known file types". You will then see that the first file is indeed
          called 30x30.dbf</li>
        <li>30x30.prj - contains information about the map <strong>projection</strong>.
          Map projections are mathematical transformations used to display the
          curved surface of the earth on a flat computer monitor. </li>
        <li>30x30.shp - contains the actual coordinates that make up the lines
          in the grid. Shape files are made up of <strong>features</strong>,
          which are individual geometric shapes used to draw the map. This shape
          file is a set of polygons with latitude and longitude lines defining
          the edges of the polygons - thus, each square on the map is a feature.
          You may also see a "LOCK File" type with the same name plus a bunch of
          random characters - lock files are used to let other programs know
          that a file is already open, and that no changes can be made (having
          two different programs changing the same file at once in incompatible
          ways is a bad thing).</li>
        <li>30x30.shx - contains an index of all the objects in the .shp file,
          which ArcMap uses to speed up its operations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these files together make up the 30x30 shape file, and all are
        needed for ArcMap to display the grid properly. If any are missing the
        data layer may not be usable. </p>
      <p>You can close the Windows Explorer window and switch back to ArcMap.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Okay, back to ArcMap.</p>
    <p>Notice that once you added 30x30.shp, the position of the mouse is now
      being displayed in the lower right corner of the map display window in
      "decimal degrees" instead of "Unknown units". Decimal degrees are latitude
      and longitude coordinates expressed as decimal numbers, with degrees as
      the whole units, and minutes and seconds translated into decimals. Note
      that this change happened automatically - ArcMap sets the units for the
      data frame by reading this information from the projection file (the one
      with the .prj extension) from the first layer added.</p>
    <p><strong>Add countries and cities to the map</strong>: Now, use the Add
      Data button to add the country and city layers from P:. You should see
      something that looks like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="Un-projected" src="countries_geographic.png"></p>
    <p>The countries and cities files were plotted together in the right
      locations because they also have .prj files that ArcMap used to determine
      the coordinates for the features in the data files. Note that the files
      don't all have to have the same units to be properly overlaid - as long as
      each shape file has a .prj file, ArcMap can do the necessary
      transformations "one the fly" to make the maps overlay properly.</p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>Right now the data frame is displaying latitude and longitude
              coordinates as though they were a simple, rectangular Cartesian
              coordinate system, but this is a poor way to display a map of the
              world. You can see the dotted longitude line at 0° in the map on
              the right. Additional longitude lines are shown every 15 degrees,
              increasing in number to the east until they reach 180°. Longitudes
              to the west of the prime meridian are negative, and they increase
              in absolute value moving west; 180° and -180° are the same line.
              From these maps you can see that latitudes are parallel with one
              another, but longitudes converge at the north and south poles.
              Displaying longitudes as rectangular coordinates that are parallel
              with one another badly distorts the size and shape of land masses
              away from the equator. This distortion results in Greenland
              looking larger than Australia.</p>

    <p>To get a more reasonable depiction of the surface of the earth, we need
      to use a projection that does a better job of representing the curves
      surface of the globe on a flat computer screen. We will learn much more
      about projections in a later lab, but for this lab we will just use a
      projection that is considered among the best for making maps of the entire
      earth, the Robinson projection. Since all we want to do is change the way
      the data are being displayed, we need to set the projection for the data
      frame, rather than setting it for the shape files themselves.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Changing the projection of a data frame</strong>: To change the
      projection being used for display, you just need to change the projection
      for the data frame in which you are currently displaying the maps. You can
      access the data frame's properties by right-clicking on the "Layers" label
      in the table of contents, then selecting "Properties" from the menu that
      pops up (the last entry in the list). The "Coordinate System" tab is where
      the current projection for the data frame is displayed, and where we can
      change it to something else: </p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_m7b0e3ea3.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 477px; height: 563px; float: left;"
        alt="coord_system" name="graphics5" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Currently, the coordinate system is listed as "GCS_WGS_1984". The GCS
      part is short for a "Geographic Coordinate System" (meaning that it is
      displaying coordinates as latitude and longitude), based on the World
      Geodetic System of 1984. You will learn more about what this means later,
      but for now the interpretation is simply that the data frame is displaying
      the latitude/longitude coordinates as though they were x,y units without
      any projection.</p>
    <p>To change the display to the Robinson projection we just need to find it
      in the folders displayed above and select it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Scroll down in the list of projections in the top panel and click on
        the "Projected Coordinate Systems" folder.</li>
      <li>Fhen find and click on the "World" folder. </li>
      <li>Find the Robinson (world) projection and select it (the projections
        are listed alphabetically).</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to use it. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your map should now look like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><img src="countries_robinson.png" style="border: 0px solid ;  float: left;"
        alt="Robinson projection" name="graphics6" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The Robinson projection keeps the latitude lines parallel and equally
      spaced apart, but allows the longitude lines to converge somewhat towards
      the poles. You'll see that even though the appearance of the map has
      changed, ArcMap still knows the latitude and longitude of the pointer on
      the screen - if you position over the equator (the horizontal line in the
      middle of the globe) it will show 0 degrees latitude, and as you approach
      the poles it will approach 90 (to the north) or -90 (to the south) degrees
      latitude. If you follow a longitude line the longitude displayed shouldn't
      change, even if you follow one of the strongly curved lines at the edges
      of the map.</p>
    <p><strong>Change the plot symbols</strong>: We can make the map more
      informative by using different plot symbols for different kinds of cities,
      using information from the cities attribute table, which is the .dbf file
      for the cities shape file (that is, it is cities.dbf). "Attributes" are
      ArcGIS's word for "variable", so attribute tables are just data tables
      made up of variables measured for each of the features in the map, along
      with some additional attributes that ArcMap uses internally to link the
      data in the table to the features in the map. Any attribute in the table
      can be used to set the plot symbol used for features.</p>
    <p>To see what ArcMap knows about the cities, right-click on "cities", and
      select "Open attribute table". A data table will open up that has the
      columns FID, Shape, AREA, PERIMETER, CITIES_, CITIES_ID, NAME, COUNTRY,
      POPULATION, and CAPITAL. You'll see that each row in the table pertains to
      a single feature in the shape file - the features are the points, and each
      point is a different city. The CAPITAL column has values Y (if the city is
      a capital), and N (if the city is not a capital) - if we wanted to have
      ArcMap use a different symbol for capital cities, we just need to tell it
      to use CAPITAL as the basis for picking a plot symbol.</p>
    <p>Close the attribute table (click the x in the upper right corner), and
      double-click the "cities" layer in the Table of Contents. This brings up
      the "Layer Properties" window - select the "Symbology" tab:</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_me4cc62c.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 662px; height: 514px; float: left;"
        alt="Symbology" name="graphics7" align="left"><br clear="left">
    </p>
    <p> Currently, every city is getting the same plot symbol. To change this,
      click on the "Categories" option from the "Show" list on the left, and
      then the "Unique Values" option below it: </p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_m44db7637.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 659px; height: 515px; float: left;"
        alt="Unique value 1" name="graphics8" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Change the "Value Field" from "AREA" to "CAPITAL", and then click "Add
      All Values":</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_13b0bf76.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 592px; height: 457px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics9"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>When you click "Add All Values", ArcMap scans the entries in CAPITAL, and
      identifies all of the unique values. In this case, the only entries are
      "Y" when a city is a national capital, and "N" when it is not. You can see
      that you're given a count of how many times each category appears in the
      file, and there are 164 capitals out of 606 cities in the layer.</p>
    <p>The plot symbols selected automatically are not very distinct, so to
      select better ones by double clicking on the one for the Y row in the
      table of contents, scroll down and select Star 3 as its plot symbol, and
      change its color to red:</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_4cd87935.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 514px; height: 495px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics10"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click OK, then OK again to apply the change. Your map should look like
      this:</p>
    <p><img src="capitals.png" style="border: 0px solid ; " alt="Capitals" name="graphics11"
        align="top"> </p>
    <br>
    <p>You can add some information about the countries as well. The attribute
      table has lots of information in it, and we could use any of the columns
      to color the countries on the map. We'll use the per-capita gross national
      product, which is a measure of wealth. Double-click on "country" and
      choose the "Quantities" from the "Show" list, and then select the
      "Graduated colors" option. Choose "Gnp_cap" as the "Value" field, which
      will display gross national product data for each country as variation in
      color. Instead of giving a different color for every unique GNP (which
      would probably give us a different color for every country), ArcMap breaks
      up the GNP numbers into bins and assigns a color from the color ramp
      selected to each bin:</p>
    <p><img src="countries_gnp.png" style="border: 0px solid ;  float: left;" alt="Countries colored by gnp"
        name="graphics12" align="left"><br clear="left">
    </p>
    <p> Click "OK" to apply the changes.</p>
    <p>You can also change the display of the layer name in the table of
      contents. Double-click the "Cities" file, and in the "General" tab change
      the layer name to "Cities of the world". Note that this does not change
      the name of the file, just the name used in the table of contents. You can
      also change the names displayed for the plot symbols - if you double-click
      on Y and select the Symbology tab, you can change the "Label" for Y to
      "Capitals", and N to "Other".</p>
    <p>Now that you're getting the idea of how to alter plot symbols, try
      changing the color of the 30x30 file to a blue color, to indicate oceans
      (keep it as a single symbol, and just change the fill color).</p>
    <p>When you're done, your map will look like:</p>
    <p><img src="first_map.png" style="border: 0px solid ;  float: left;" alt="First map"
        name="graphics13" align="left"><br clear="left">

    <h2 style=" margin-bottom: 0in;">Lesson 2</h2>
    <p>We will take a quick look at another type of data commonly used in GIS,
      an aerial photo. <br>
    </p>
    <p>For this lesson we will be working with a much smaller area, and it
      doesn't make sense to work in the same map as the world map you used for
      Lesson 1. You can add a new data frame for this smaller area by selecting
      "Insert → Data Frame" from the menu bar. You will get a new data frame
      called (creatively) "New Data Frame", with nothing in it. Your map display
      will thus go blank, but you haven't lost anything - if you right-click on
      "Layers" and select "Activate" your "Layers" data frame will be turned
      back on, and your world map will be displayed again. </p>
    <p>Right-click and "Activate" your "New Data Frame". Then, click on the "add
      data" button as before, and navigate to the Lesson02 folder. Select the
      file "airphoto.bil", and click "OK".</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_19aed335.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 690px; height: 425px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics14"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>This is a gray scale aerial photo of an urban scene. The air photo is an
      example of <strong>raster</strong> data, made up of a rectangular array
      of cells (called <strong>pixels</strong>), each of which has a single
      value assigned to it. Images are a type of raster data that store numbers
      indicating intensity of light reflected off the surface within each pixel.
      In a grayscale image like this one, each pixel has a number from 0 to 255
      indicating intensity of light reflecting off the surface, and displayed on
      the screen as a shade of gray.</p>
    <p>Now, in spite of the fact that all the <em>computer</em> knows about
      this image is the value from 0 to 255 for each pixel, <em>you</em> can
      presumably see that there are buildings, roads, trees, and other features
      on the ground. Humans are good at interpreting features in an image, but
      to make that information known to the computer it's necessary to make data
      layers that indicate the features we see in the image.</p>
    <p>Fortunately this interpretation has been done for us. Add the other files
      that are in the directory and see how they overlay the image (NOTE: you
      can select more than one at a time to add by CTRL+clicking on the names of
      the files until all are selected). Notice that each file is named for the
      type of feature that it maps - you now have a layer each for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lights</li>
      <li>Waterlines</li>
      <li>Sewerlines</li>
      <li>Buildings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, GIS data is constructed as "thematic" layers, meaning that
      each layer only represents a single kind of feature. For example, both the
      waterline and sewerline layers are shape files geometrically represented
      with lines, but we aren't mixing them together into a single layer. We may
      want to know whether waterlines and sewerlines tend to parallel each
      other, but we can do that by adding both layers to the map and observing
      them both at once.</p>
    <p>The bldgs, sewars, waterln, and lights files are examples of <strong>vector</strong>
      data, because they are made up of geometric shapes. Vector data can be
      made up of polygons (like the buildings), lines (like the water and sewer
      lines), or points (like the lights). We'll learn more about raster and
      vector data in the next lab.</p>
    <p>Notice that one of the problems with displaying more than one layer at a
      time, and overlaying them with an image, is that they can block each
      other. The order that the layers are drawn is the order they appear in the
      Table of Contents, and you can change the order they are drawn by dragging
      them into a different order. Try dragging airphoto.bil into the first
      position, just under "New Data Frame" - you'll see that when it's on top
      the image blocks all of the other layers. Drag it back to the bottom so
      you can see the other layers again.</p>
    <p>Currently, the filled polygons of the bldgs polygon layer are blocking
      the image. If you want to see what the buildings look like on the image,
      you can turn off the "bldgs polygon" layer by un-checking its box.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can leave the buildings turned on (check the box), but
      use an un-filled polygon to represent them, so that you can see through
      the polygon to the image behind it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double-click on "bldgs polygon".</li>
      <li>Switch to the "Symbology" tab in "Layer Properties".</li>
      <li>Click on "Symbol" and select "Hollow" as the color.</li>
      <li>Click "OK" and you'll see that the buildings are now only outlines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style=" margin-bottom: 0in;">Lesson 3</h2>
    <p>For the final exercise, we will make more use of the information in the
      attribute table of a data layer, and will get some practice moving around
      the map. </p>
    <p>The data layers we will work with are of the greater Atlanta, GA area.
      Insert a new data frame for this new geographic area.</p>
    <p><strong>Panning and zooming</strong>: Add the "cities.shp" file from the
      <strong>lesson03</strong> directory. You will also need to add interstate
      highways ("inter.shp") and counties ("counties.shp").</p>
    <p>ArcMap decides the area to display in the map window based on the first
      layer you added. It sets the extent of the map (i.e. the north, south,
      east, and west edges of the display) and the scale (i.e. the zoom level)
      so that the layer will fill the screen with a little bit of empty space on
      each side. Tools that we commonly use to change the extent and scale are
      here:</p>
    <img alt="Tools" src="pan_and_zoom_labeled.png"><br>
    <p>Zooming refers to changing the scale. The scale of the map is shown in a
      drop-down box next to the "add data" button. Map scales are expressed as
      ratios of units on the map to units in the real world - so, a scale of
      1:500,000 would mean that 1 unit on the map is equal to 500,000 of the
      same units in the real world. If you measured a distance of 1 cm between
      two cities on the map, that would be equal to 500,000 cm (or 5 km) in the
      real world.</p>
    <p>To zoom in, click on the "zoom in" tool and drag a box on the screen that
      you want to zoom to - that is, left-click on one corner of the area you
      want to see, hold down the left mouse button, move the cursor to the
      opposite corner of the area you want to see, and release the left mouse
      button. You'll see that the area you dragged the box around is not
      magnified and centered on the screen. The scale will have changed too -
      since you're looking at a smaller area, one unit on the screen is now
      representing a smaller distance in the real world, maybe something like
      1:100,000.</p>
    <p>To zoom out, you can click on the "zoom out" tool, and click once in the
      middle of the map - you'll see that you zoom out with the display centered
      where you clicked. If you click on an edge of the map with the zoom out
      tool you will zoom out and re-center on that edge.</p>
    <p>FYI, you can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel - scrolling the
      wheel towards you zooms in, and away from you zooms out. Bear in mind,
      though, that using the scroll wheel with big maps can cause the software
      to bog down - as the wheel scrolls it issues a zoom in or out command
      repeatedly in rapid succession, and ArcMap can have a hard time keeping
      up. Using the zoom in and zoom out tools prevents this problem. Try not to
      get into the habit of using the scroll wheel, it will give you heartburn
      later.</p>
    <p>To change the extent without changing the zoom level use the "pan" tool.
      Select it, and left-click and drag the map to change the extent.</p>
    <p>To zoom out so that every layer in the map is fully displayed, click on
      the "Zoom to full extent" button - you should see all of the map layers,
      with a small amount of white space all around the edges.</p>
    <p><strong>Zooming to a layer extent</strong>: Zooming to the full extent
      took us further out than where we started, because the counties layer
      covers a larger area than the cities layer did. If we just want to zoom
      out far enough to see all the cities, we can zoom to the extent of the
      cities layer instead of to the full extent. Right-click on the "cities"
      layer, and select "Zoom to layer" - this will take you back to the zoom
      level you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>Labeling features</strong>: We will now add labels to the cities.
      Select the "cities" data layer, right-click, and select "Label Features".</p>
    <p><img src="label_features.png" style="border: 0px solid ;  float: left;" alt="Label"
        name="graphics17" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>ArcMap will select a column to use for labels automatically, and in this
      case it finds the right one. But, you will often want to assign labels
      other than the ones selected by default; for that, open up the properties
      for the cities layer, and select the "Labels" tab. The "Text String"
      section is where the column that contains the labels is identified, and
      we're using "CITY_NAME" currently. You can also change the font, size,
      color, and other attributes of the labels in the "Text Symbol" area. The
      "Pre-defined" button will take you to a set of common text styles that
      work well in maps for various types of features, which you can use.</p>
    <p><strong>Querying attributes</strong>: Another way to move around the map
      is to find attributes of interest, and then zoom to their location. We can
      do this by querying the attribute table to find the features we want, and
      then zoom to them.</p>
    <p>Open the attribute table, click the "Options" button (left-most on the
      button bar of the attribute table), and select the "Select By Attributes"
      menu item:</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_m212b9e26.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 341px; height: 270px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics19" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>A window will pop up that will help you build a query to select the
      cities you want (of course, there are so few cities in this file that it's
      not really necessary to query the table, but the same procedure will work
      for large files as well). Find "CITY_NAME" from the list of column names,
      and double-click on it. It should now appear in the space below, like
      this:</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_701e8264.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 381px; height: 493px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics20" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>To generate a list of the cities that appear in the file, click on "Get
      Unique Values" - the city names should now appear in the box above this
      button. We want to select Atlanta and Decatur, which means we have to
      build our query with two parts, one for each city. First we will choose
      "Atlanta." Click on the "=" button in the block of mathematical operators
      in the middle of the query window, and then double-click on "Atlanta" from
      the list of cities. Since we want both cities, we want any record in the
      table that has Atlanta or that has Decatur; click the "or" button, then
      double-click [City_name] = "Decatur." Your query should look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="lab1_tutorial_html_m58dfd9b5.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 381px; height: 494px; float: left;"
        alt="" name="graphics21" align="left"><br clear="left">
      <br>
      Finally, click "Apply". You should see two rows highlighted in your table,
      one for each city. Close the table and you will also see them highlighted
      on the map (closing the table does not clear the selection). To zoom in so
      that these two cities fill the screen, right-click on the "cities" layer,
      and select "Selection → Zoom to selected features". You should see
      something like this:</p>
    <p><img src="zoom_selected.png" style="border: 0px solid; float: left; width: 561px; height: 395px;"
        alt="Zoom to selected" name="graphics22"><br clear="left">
    </p>
    <p>The color contrast isn't great, but you can see the two cities in a light
      blue on the right and left sides of the map.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We can also search for portions of attributes. If we wanted to find all
      the cities that have "ville" as part of their names, we would use the
      "Like" operator, along with a "wildcard" character that the computer
      interprets as "Any characters can appear here". Start up the select by
      attribute window again, but this time build the expression: </p>
    <p>"CITY_NAME" LIKE '%ville%'</p>
    <p>and click "Apply". You'll see that you have Lawrenceville and
      Douglasville selected. The "Like" operator means that only part of the
      city name has to match the criteria, and the wildcards say that any
      characters can occur before or after ville, as long as ville occurs
      someplace in the name. The percent operator means "any number of
      characters can occur here".</p>
    <p>Zoom to selected features for these two "villes". Again, you'll see the
      two selected cities at the right and left edges of the map.</p>
    <p>ArcMap keeps track of the extents and scales that you've used, and allows
      you to scroll backward and forward through them. You can go back to the
      zoom level from the previous map by clicking the "Go back to previous
      extent" button, which is the left-pointing blue arrow, <img alt="Previous"
        src="previous_extent.png">. After you use the "Go back to previous
      extent" button the "Go to next extent" button becomes active (the
      right-pointing blue arrow), and you can use it to return to the map zoomed
      to the "villes".</p>
