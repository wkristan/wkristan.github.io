    <h1>Lab 8 - Raster and vector spatial overlays</h1>
    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Spatial overlays combine information from two or more maps, and are
      fundamental GIS operations. Overlaying maps allows the associations
      between two different characteristics of the landscape to be evaluated.
      Spatial overlays are also important in developing GIS models, like the
      ones you will be constructing for the lab project this semester. For
      example, we may be interested in finding all of the coastal sage-scrub
      within the Escondido city limits, or in finding vegetation that falls
      within 100 m of a stream, or in finding all of the north-facing slopes
      that are above 1000 m elevation. In each case, we would need to use the
      information in two different data layers in order to arrive at our desired
      outcome, and overlays provide the needed tools.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Both vector and raster data can be overlaid, but the procedure is quite
      different for each. We'll learn both today.</p>
    <h1>Vector overlays</h1>
    <p>Fundamentally, overlays are set operations, equivalent to logical "and",
      "or", and "not". The basic operations we will be working with are:</p>
    <p><img src="clip_int_union.png" style="width: 579px; height: 442px;" alt="Overlays"></p>
    <p> <b>Clip</b> - The intersection of two layers is found, but only the
      features in one layer is retained (the other acts as a "cookie cutter").
      This is a logical "and" operation, because in the end only parts of
      features that are common to both layers are kept.</p>
    <p> <b>Intersect</b> - The intersection of two layers is found, and the
      overlapping regions of both layers are retained and merged into a new
      layer. Both the lines that define the polygons and the attribute tables
      are merged. Intersection is also a logical "and" operation.</p>
    <p><b> Union</b> - All features and attributes, both overlapping and
      non-overlapping, from two layers are merged into one. This is a logical
      "or" operation, because in the end all of the features that occur in
      either map are kept.</p>
    <p><b> Erase</b> - Similar to "clip" in that information from only one layer
      is retained, but the overlapping region between layers is deleted rather
      than saved (not illustrated above). Only information from the first layer
      is retained. This is a logical "not", because only parts of features that
      do not overlap with the bounding layer are retained.</p>
    <h2>Merging two layers during an overlay</h2>
    <p> What does it mean for features and attributes of two files to be
      retained? Consider this example:</p>
    <br>
    <img src="vec_overlay.png" style="width: 800px; height: 432px;" alt="VegOverlay">
    <p>This illustration shows how an overlay will merge both the geometry of
      the polygons, and the attribute table in the output file. Union and
      intersect operations differ when the outer boundaries of the layers are
      different, but here the outer boundaries for Layer 1 and Layer 2 are the
      same; either an intersection or a union would give us the same result in
      this case. </p>
    <p>The interior lines that define the features are different in the two
      different layers. Layer 1 has data on the vegetation type ("Veg Type"),
      and Layer 2 has data on soils ("Soils"). When these layers are overlaid,
      the lines forming the polygons are combined, and new polygons are formed
      in the output layer by combining the lines from each and then forming new
      polygons from them. Each one of these new polygons had a "Veg type" in
      Layer 1, and a "Soils" type in Layer 2, and thus the output attribute data
      now gives the attributes on both of these variables. Each new polygon in
      the output layer is delineated based on the combination of vegetation type
      and soil type, which changes the geometry of the polygons.</p>
    <p>We tend to keep raw data layers as simple as possible, and to represent
      as few different "themes" as possible with them, and only combine them
      when we need to. For example, in the illustration above, having vegetation
      type and soil type separate makes it maximally easy to map vegetation
      polygons without having them split by the underlying soil type - if all we
      wanted to do was to map vegetation then it's not desirable to have the
      patches of CSS and chaparral divided into two because of the underlying
      soils. Likewise, if we wanted to measure the average size of patches of
      vegetation like we did last week, the underlying soil type is irrelevant,
      and having our vegetation maps broken up by soil type would give us
      polygons that are too small. </p>
    <p>However, if we want to answer a question about the relationship between
      vegetation and soils, or if we want to identify all of the CSS that has
      loamy soils, then we need to combine the maps. So, generally it's best to
      have basic data layers represent just one type of data (one "theme"), and
      combine them only when one is answering a question that requires them to
      be combined.</p>
    <h2>GIS models</h2>
    <p>One of the primary uses of overlays is to build GIS models. A GIS model
      is simply a map that represents the areas that meet a set of conditions.
      For example, riparian vegetation near stream courses is potentially
      ecologically interesting - it is often made up of different plant species
      than upland areas, it prevents soil erosion, and can filter sediment and
      pollutants from rainwater runoff. </p>
    <p><it is="" common="" for="" development="" projects="" to="" be="" required=""
        maintain="" some="" specified="" distance="" away="" from="" streams=""
        prevent="" water="" pollution,="" and="" protect="" riparian="" vegetation.=""
        if="" we="" wanted="" know="" what="" kinds="" of="" vegetation="" fall=""
        within="" the="" buffer="" zone,="" could="" overlay="" 500="" m="" with=""
        a="" layer,="" which="" then="" gis="" model="" zone.<="" p=""> </it></p>
    <p>So, to build this GIS model we need to 1) buffer the streams by 500 m
      (which you already know how to do), and then 2) clip the vegetation with
      your stream buffer (which is new to you today).</p>
    <h2>Exercise 1: GIS model of streamside vegetation - clipping and erasing</h2>
    <p>Remember to work on the C: drive of the virtual desktop, not of the
      computer you're working on, and not on the H: drive. You can back up all
      your files to H: at the end of the day, but these operations will go
      extremely slowly if you try to work directly on H:.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Buffering streams</strong>. Add the layer "Streams.shp" to
      your project, and open the "Arc Toolbox". Find "Analysis Tools" →
      "Proximity" → "Buffer". Double-click to launch the tool.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select "streams" as the input features. The output file will be called
        "streams_Buffer.shp" by default, which is fine; just make sure it's
        placed in your working directory on your S: drive.</li>
      <li>Set the "Distance" Linear Unit to 500 and the units to meters</li>
      <li>Set the "Dissolve Type" to "ALL". The dissolve type option determines
        how to handle any overlap in the buffers around different features. We
        want any interior lines in overlapping buffers to be removed.</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to buffer the streams. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. <strong>Clipping the vegetation within 500 m of streams</strong>.
      Either clipping or intersection would give us the same polygons of
      vegetation within 500 m of streams. However, we don't need anything from
      the attribute table of the 500 m buffer, all we need is to use the buffer
      as a cookie cutter for the vegetation. Since clipping doesn't add anything
      to the attribute table, clip is the better choice.</p>
    <p> Add the "vegetation.shp" layer to your project. This is a simplified
      version of the vegetation map that combines some of the polygons that are
      only slightly different. It also has had boundaries dissolved between
      adjacent polygons of the same vegetation type.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find "Analysis Tools", → Extract" → "Clip", and double-click to launch
        the tool. </li>
      <li>Use "vegetation" as the "Input Features". If you look at the help
        provided with the tool, you'll see that the "INPUT" layer has the data
        you wish to clip.</li>
      <li>Use "streams_Buffer" as the "Clip Features". The help provided with
        the tool shows that the "CLIP FEATURE" is used to cut out the input data
        to form the output.</li>
      <li>Use the default output file name "veg_Clip.shp" for the "Output
        Feature Class" (but put it on your S: drive). </li>
      <li>Click "OK" to clip the vegetation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you're done, the clipped vegetation map should look like <a href="clipped_veg.png">this</a>.</p>
    <h3>Two problems, before you go on</h3>
    <p>Turn on the original vegetation layer, and put vegetation_Clip on top of
      it. You can see that the polygons from the vegetation layer have been cut
      into pieces. Click on the "<a href="select_features.png">Select features</a>"
      tool, and then click on the large polygon in the middle of the buffered
      stream in the middle of the screen, like <a href="select_features1.png">this</a>.
      You can see that although the original vegetation polygons were cut, they
      are still considered part of one feature with multiple parts in the output
      file (click someplace in the white background to clear the selection).
      This could be a problem if we wanted to calculate the average areas or
      perimeters of the clipped vegetation polygons. To solve this, we can use
      the "Data Management Tools", "Features", "Multipart to Singlepart" tool to
      break them into separate polygons. Do this, and call the output
      "veg_Clip_sp.shp". Now that you have your workspace defined, you should be
      able to just edit the file name and click "OK".</p>
    <p>Second, and much more importantly, the geometry fields in the attribute
      table are wrong. Click on the "<a href="identify.png">Identify tool</a>",
      and set the tool to "Identify from:" "&lt;Visible layers&gt;. Click on the
      same clipped polygon you selected before, and compare the areas and
      perimeters between vegetation and vegetation_Clip. You'll see that the
      areas and perimeters are the same, because the clip operation did not
      automatically update them. To solve this, right-click on
      "vegetation_Clip_sp" and open its attribute table. Add an "Area" column,
      and use "Calculate Geometry" to add an area column. Make sure that "Area"
      is the property being calculated, use square meters as the units, and
      un-check the "Calculate selected records only" option.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Erasing vegetation within 500 m from a stream</strong>. We
      can now make a map that is the complement of the map we just made, in that
      it contains only vegetation that is greater than 500 m from streams.</p>
    <p>Find "Analysis Tools" → "Overlay" → "Erase" and launch it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use "vegetation.shp" as the Input Feature</li>
      <li>Use "streams_Buffer.shp" as the Erase Features</li>
      <li>Call the output file "veg_Erase.shp", and put it on your S: drive.</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you're done, you should have a vegetation map that only includes
      polygons greater than 500 m from streams. Zoom in on the edges between the
      clipped and erased files, and you'll see they match exactly.</p>
    <p>This file has the same problem that we encountered in the Clip operation
      - it's multipart, and the areas and perimeters in the attribute table are
      wrong and need to be updated. Convert the file to single part, add an Area
      field, and calculate the area for the polygons.</p>
    <h2>Associations between layers</h2>
    <p>Using clipping is fine for identifying vegetation within a buffer zone,
      but if we were interested in something like the association between
      vegetation and soils we would need to combine two layers into one. The
      vector overlays that will do this are intersections and unions. The output
      layer from either of these operations will have an attribute table with
      both the vegetation type and the soil type of each polygon in the layer,
      and we can use the combined layer to see whether some vegetation types are
      more likely to be found on particular soil types.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 2: Intersections and unions</h2>
    <p>Intersection and union operations are very similar, differing only in
      that intersections only retain the areas that overlap between two layers,
      whereas unions include all features from both layers, including those that
      do not overlap. When you are working with maps that cover exactly the same
      area there will be no difference in the output from the two. Our
      vegetation and soils maps cover the same area, and thus we will just use
      intersection today. </p>
    <h3>Using intersection to study the relationship between vegetation and
      soils.</h3>
    <p>1. Add the "soil_texture.shp" layer to your project. This is a simplified
      version of a soils map available for our region, that just gives
      information about the texture of the soil (sandy, rocky, silty, clay), but
      omits more detailed information.</p>
    <p>2. Find "Analysis Tools" → "Overlay" → "Intersect" and double-click to
      launch the tool.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add both soils and vegetation as "Input Feature" (select them one at a
        time). </li>
      <li>Set the "Output Feature Class" to "veg_soils.shp", on your S: drive. </li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the tool. This operation may take awhile - be
        patient.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add and area and perimeter field if there isn't one already, or update
      them if they already exist.</p>
    <p>3. Export the attribute table for veg_soils to an Excel file. Open the
      file in Excel, and construct a pivot table with vegetation descriptions as
      rows, soil descriptions as columns, and the sum of the polygon areas as
      the data values. Answer the questions on your assignment sheet about
      relationships between soils and vegetation.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 3: Proximity searches</h2>
    <p>Another way that GIS allows us to better understand the spatial
      relationships in our data is through <strong>topological</strong>
      relationships. Topology refers to relationships between geometric shapes,
      based on connections between them. For example, finding lines that share a
      vertex in common allow us to treat a set of lines on the map as a stream
      network, and finding edges that are shared by two adjacent polygons allows
      us to identify cases in which two different vegetation types are next to
      each other.</p>
    <p>For example, if we wanted to know which of the vegetation polygons shared
      an edge with urban areas, we could do the following:</p>
    <p>First, we will put all of the urban polygons into a layer.</p>
    <p>1. Right-click on "vegetation", and open the attribute table.</p>
    <p>2. From the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of the Table window,
      choose "Select by attribute".</p>
    <p>3. Enter "VEG_TYPE" into the "Select * FROM vegetation WHERE" query
      builder (by double-clicking "VEG_TYPE") and click on "Get Unique Values".
      Then click on "=" and double-click "Urban/Developed" to enter it into the
      query. Your query should read "VEG_TYPE" = "Urban/Developed". Click
      "Apply" to select the urban polygons.</p>
    <p>4. Close the attribute table, and right click on "vegetation". Select
      "Selection" → "Create layer from selected features". This puts the urban
      polygons into a temporary layer that you can use in the next step. Re-name
      the urban polygon layer from "vegetation selection" to "Urban".</p>
    <p>Now we can use the "Urban" layer to select polygons that share an edge
      with one or more of the urban polygons.</p>
    <p>5. Right-click on "vegetation" and clear the selected features
      ("Selection" → "Clear selected features")</p>
    <p>6. From the "Selection" menu, choose "Select by location". In the "Select
      by Location" window, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the box next to "vegetation" to make it the "Target layer" -
        this is the data set we're extracting information from.</li>
      <li>In the "Source layer" drop-down list, select your "Urban" polygon
        layer.</li>
      <li>In the "Spatial selection method for target layer feature(s):" drop
        down, choose "Touch the boundary of the source layer feature". Notice
        that there are many possible choices here - you can read the ArcGIS help
        files for an explanation of what each of them do if you're curious.</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to apply the selection criterion. You'll see that a large
        fraction of the landscape has adjacent edges with urban polygons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>7. You'll see that a large number of polygons are selected, but we have a
      problem - the urban polygons share an edge with themselves, so the urban
      polygons are being selected from the vegetation layer as well, but we only
      want non-urban polygons that share an edge. We can fix this by doing a
      "select by attribute" on the attribute table in which we leave out the
      urban areas (which we already know how to do, right?), or we can use
      "Select by location" again to remove the polygons that intersect with the
      "Urban" layer. We'll do the latter for practice.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start "Select by location" again, and keep "vegetation" as the "Target
        layer" and "Urban" as the "Source layer".</li>
      <li>Change the "Selection method" to "remove from the currently selected
        features in"</li>
      <li>Change the "Spatial selection method for the target layer feature(s):"
        to "are identical to source layer feature".</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to apply the criterion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It will look like nothing happened, because the selected polygons are
      indicated by the polygon edges, and we selected the vegetation that shared
      an edge with urban polygons. But, if you now create a layer from the
      selection and re-name it "Adjacent to urban", you'll see that you have a
      layer with polygons next to urban polygons, but that are not themselves
      urban polygons.</p>
    <h2>Exercise 4: Overlays with raster data</h2>
    <p>It is possible to do all of these spatial overlays using raster data as
      well as vector data, but the procedure is quite different. Because raster
      maps match on a pixel by pixel basis, we don't need an intersect or union
      operation to look at the associations between maps, we can just use the <strong>raster
        calculator</strong>. The raster calculator is usable for a variety of
      mathematical operations on raster maps, using a set of operations and
      rules called <strong>map algebra</strong>.</p>
    <p>To do the equivalent of a "clip" or "erase" operation on raster data, we
      will take advantage of a raster category called "No Data" that is used to
      represent pixels that have no value assigned to them. This is not the same
      as a 0 value, since zero is a number and can be a measured value (for
      example, if we put out a rain gauge and no rain falls, we have a value of
      0 rainfall, but if we don't put out the rain gauge at all we have No
      Data). In the rules of&nbsp;map algebra, any mathematical operation
      applied to a cell that contains a "no data" value makes the result "no
      data" as well. </p>
    <p>So, for example, if we have a buffer map that has a value of 1 for every
      pixel that is within 500 m of a stream, and a value of "no data" for
      pixels farther than 500 m from a stream, we could find the vegetation that
      fell within 500 m of a stream by multiplying our vegetation map by the
      buffer map. This would be equivalent to a clip or erase operation if these
      were vector data. Since the operation is done by setting some pixels to 1
      and some to NoData, but there's no "inside" or "outside" of a polygon to
      worry about, there isn't really a distinction between clip and erase for
      raster data.</p>
    <h3>Clipping/erasing with raster data.</h3>
    <p>1. Locate "Conversion Tools" → "To Raster" → "Polygon to Raster" and
      double-click to launch the tool. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use "vegetation" as the "Input Feature"</li>
      <li>Use "veg_type" as the "Value Field"</li>
      <li>Use "veg_rast" as the output file name (no filename extension)</li>
      <li>Set the "cell size" to 100 (feet, since this map is in the state plane
        coordinate system)</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will create a raster version of the vegetation map, with cell values
      equal to the veg_type.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>2. Next, we will make a raster buffer map at 500 m from the stream. If
      you recall, this is done in two steps: a) first, make a distance raster
      map, and then b) find all distance less than or equal to 500 m.</p>
    <p>Distances are calculated with "Spatial Analyst Tools" → "Distance" →
      "Euclidean Distance". </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assign "streams" to the input feature source</li>
      <li>Call the output "streams_dist". </li>
      <li>Use the same cell size for the veg_rast layer (100). </li>
      <li>Click on "Environment" and select the "Processing Extent" option.
        Change the extent to "Same as layer veg_rast" - if you don't do this,
        the distance calculations will stop at the ends of the streams, and
        won't extend to the entire vegetation map. '</li>
      <li>Click on "OK" to produce your raster distances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, to get the pixels within 500 m, select "Spatial Analyst" →
      "Reclass" → "Reclassify".</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use streams_dist as the input raster.</li>
      <li>You will see in the "Reclassification" table that the distances will
        be broken up into several different data ranges, but we will only need
        the first, last, and the "NoData" row in the table. Select the other
        rows and click "Delete Entries".</li>
      <li>We need to re-classify any distances within 500 m of the stream to
        receive a value of 1. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert 500 m to feet - there are 1640 ft in 500 m.</li>
        <li>Set the first row of "Old values" to "0-1640", and set the first row
          of "New values" to 1. This will assign a 1 to any distance between 0
          and 1640.</li>
        <li>Now all remaining "Old values" will be set to "NoData". The biggest
          distance in the map is just under 69578, so set the second row of "Old
          values" to "1640-69578", and set the second row of "New values" to
          "NoData". Make sure you capitalize the N and D, and don't put a space
          between "No" and "Data".</li>
        <li>The "Output raster" default file name is fine, it should be called
          "Reclass_strea". </li>
        <li>Click "OK" to do the reclassification.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Now you can clip the vegetation raster using your buffer raster.</p>
    <p>Find "Spatial Analyst" → "Map Algebra" → "Raster Calculator" and launch
      it. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double-click on "veg_rast" to add it to the expression in the box in
        the middle of the tool. </li>
      <li>Next click on the "*" button, which is multiplication to a computer. </li>
      <li>Then, double-click on "Reclass_strea". You should end up with an
        expression that looks like this:<br>
        <br>
        [veg_rast] * [Reclass_strea]<br>
      </li>
      <li>Name the output raster "veg_clip_rast"</li>
      <li>Click on "OK" to evaluate this expression.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. When the raster calculator evaluates this expression, you'll notice
      that the output only retained the "VALUE" from the original veg_rast, but
      not the vegetation type codes. The "VALUE" field in veg_rast matches the
      "VALUE" field in our final clipped raster map, though, so we can add the
      veg types codes by "joining" them to the attribute table of the original
      veg_rast layer. Joining means that the information in one data table is
      matched to the data in another based on a matching column.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on "veg_clip_rast" and select "Joins and Relates" →
        "Join". </li>
      <li>Use the "VALUE" field for "1. Choose the field in this layer...". </li>
      <li>For "2. Chooose the table to join to this layer...", use "veg_rast".</li>
      <li>For "3. Choose the field in the table to base the join on", also use
        "VALUE". </li>
      <li>Click "OK".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you now right-click on veg_clip_rast and open its attribute table,
      you'll see that the veg_type descriptions are now included in
      veg_clip_rast. You can close the table,&nbsp;double-click on
      veg_clip_rast, and select the "Symbology" tab. Change the type to "Unique
      Values", and set the "Value Field" to "veg_rast.vat:veg_type", and click
      "OK". Your map should now display the vegetation within 500 m from a
      stream, color coded by vegetation type.</p>
    <p> 5. To permanently add the vegetation codes to your clipped raster
      vegetation layer, use the "Lookup" function. Find and launch "Spatial
      Analyst" → "Reclass" → "Lookup". </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use "veg_clip_rast" as the input raster</li>
      <li>Use "veg_rast.vat:veg_type" as the lookup field. This indicates that
        from the "value attribute table" (or vat) of the "veg_rast" file, look
        up the "veg_type" field and add it to pixels with matching numbers in
        their VALUE fields. </li>
      <li>Put the output on your S: drive (call it "rveg_holland").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;If you right-click on rveg_holland and open the attribute table,
      you'll see veg_type is now permanently part of the attribute table.</p>
