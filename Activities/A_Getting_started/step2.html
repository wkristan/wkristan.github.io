    <h2>Step 2. Connecting to a folder.</h2>
    <p>We need to add a couple of map layers, but before we can do that we need
      to make a "folder connection".</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1. Click on the "Add data" button at the top of the screen, it's
            the little yellow diamond with a + on it, like in the picture to the
            right. If you hover over it you will see a "tool tip" pop up that
            will tell you what the tool is for.</td>
          <td><img src="add_data.png"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>2. In the "Add Data" window that pops up you will need to
              establish a new "folder connection" to the place where all the
              files are kept. The animation to the right shows you the steps -
              you need to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Click on the "Connect to folder" button.</li>
              <li>Click on the "Computer" icon.</li>
              <li>Click on the "Public on Viking (P:)" network location icon.</li>
              <li>Click on the "Biology" folder.</li>
              <li>Click on the "kristanw" folder.</li>
              <li>Click on the "MHHS" folder.</li>
              <li>Then to finish making the connection, clock on "OK".</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will be back in the "Add Data" window, with four folders
              showing.</p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="folder_connection.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3. Double-click on the Activity1 folder, and select
            "Landmarks.shp" file, and click "Add".</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="add_your_data.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now, click the "Add data" button again, select "World Imagery.lyr", and
      add it to the map. Your map should now look like this:</p>
    <img style="width: 629px; height: 448px;" alt="Landmarks" src="landmarks.png">
    <p>The Landmarks layer just has two points in it, one for Mission Hills
      High, and one for CSU San Marcos. Since it was the first file we added the
      map is zoomed in to show the "extent" of this file - in other words, the
      map zoomed in with MHHS in the upper right corner, and CSUSM in the lower
      left. You can see the MHHS track and football field in the upper right
      corner, and CSUSM's track and field in the lower left.</p>
    <p>You may not be able to see the points for our landmarks - if you un-check
      the box next to "Imagery" in the white "Table of Contents" area to the
      left of your image, the image will be removed from the map and you'll see
      the two little dots that represent the schools.</p>
    <p> Now that you have an image to look at, we can learn how to explore a
      little - in step 3 you'll learn to pan and zoom to look at parts of the
      image that interest you.</p>
