    <h2>Step 3 - panning and zooming </h2>
    <p>Now that you have something to look at, let's have a look around - if you
      turned off the image, check the box to turn it back on. You can also click
      on the "Transportation" box, which will show roads to help you stay
      oriented.</p>
    <p>Moving around the map is done by panning and zooming. To <strong>pan</strong>
      means to move left, right, up, or down without changing the zoom level. To
      <strong>zoom</strong> means to either look at a larger area (zooming out)
      or a smaller area (zooming in).<br>
    </p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>1. First we'll pan. The pan tool is the little hand button, as
              shown in the image to the right. Click on the hand (like the
               animation on the right), and then click and hold
              anywhere in the image and drag it around. </p>
            <p>See if you can go find the intersection of Highway 15 and Highway
              78 to the right (note that ArcMap makes its maps "north oriented",
              meaning that north is to the top. This puts south to the bottom,
              west to the left, and east to the right - panning right means
              you're heading east).</p>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>2. Now we will zoom out. Click on the "Zoom out" button, just to
              the left of the pan button. </p>
            <p>Now to zoom out you can either just click somewhere in the image
              to zoom out, and the map will re-center where you clicked and will
              zoom out by a fixed amount. See how many clicks it takes you to
              zoom out enough to see the ocean.</p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="zoom_out.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3. We can zoom in using the (you guessed it) "Zoom in" button,
            which is right next to the "Zoom out" button. <br>
            <p>You can zoom in by clicking on the image, which will act like the
              zoom out button in that it will re-center where you clicked and
              zoom by a fixed amount. </p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="zoom_in.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>You can also zoom in by dragging a box - left-click and hold in
            one corner, drag to the opposite corner, and the map will zoom so
            that the box you dragged fills the screen.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="zoom_in_box.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of how to move around the map,
      we'll learn a way to get back to your original, home position if you ever
      get lost. On to step 4. </p>
