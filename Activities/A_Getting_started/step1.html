    <p>We will be doing all of our work today with <strong>GIS</strong>
      software. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) refers to software that is
      designed to work with maps, aerial images, and other types of <strong>geospatial
        data</strong>. Geospatial data is anything that has a location that can
      be mapped.</p>
    <p>At CSUSM, we use the GIS that is made by ESRI (Environmental Systems
      Research Institute), called ArcGIS. ArcGIS is actually a collection of
      distinct programs that perform different aspects of mapping and spatial
      data analysis, and we will be working with just one part of it, called
      ArcMap.</p>
    <h3 id="Step1">Step 1. Starting ArcMap.</h3>
    <p>The first thing we need to do is to get ArcMap up and running.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>1. From the Start menu, start typing the word "arcmap", and you
              will see an icon for "ArcMap" appear. Select it to launch the
              ArcMap desktop environment.</p>
            <p>What happens next is a little odd, but bear with me... this first
              time you run ArcMap you won't get the program, you will get a
              second Windows desktop (the older Windows 7). We have found
              through hard experience that ArcMap runs better in its own desktop
              environment, so that's what you get this first time.</p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="arcmap.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>2. Within ArcMap's desktop environment, select the Start menu,
              and once again type "arcmap", and hit the ENTER key.</p>
            <p>This time the actual ArcMap program will start.</p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="start_arcmap.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>You should see a window that looks like this:</p>
    <img style="width: 580px; height: 436px;" alt="Empty environment" src="empty_environment.png">
    <p> If you get an "ArcMap - Getting Started" window floating on top of this
      one, you can just click on the "Cancel" button to close it.</p>
    <p>Victory! Now let's get some imagery added to the map.</p>
