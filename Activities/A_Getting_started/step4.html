    <h3>Step 4 - Getting lost and finding home. </h3>
    <p>With all this panning and zooming it's easy to lose track of where you
      are. There is a quick method for getting back to where we started, so
      let's get thoroughly lost so we can try it out.</p>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>1. Zoom in somewhere on the map so far that all you see is blurry
              color, like the picture to the right.</p>
          </td>
          <td><img alt="Too far" src="lost.png"><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Then, right-click on the "Landmarks" layer in the table of
            contents, and select "Zoom to layer". This will zoom out to the
            extent of the Landmarks layer, which is where we started.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="zoom_to_layer.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now that you know how to move around, see if you can find your house.
      With the "Transportation" features showing you should be able to use road
      names to locate it. How much detail can you see? Can you see individual
      cars on the street? Can you tell trees, lawns, shrubs, and other kinds of
      landscaping apart?</p>
    <p>Now pan and zoom until you find an undeveloped area, like the hills south
      of CSUSM. Can you tell shrubby vegetation from grassy vegetation in the
      undeveloped area?</p>
    <p>That's it for the first activity - if you're done early...</p>
    <p>The Landmarks file we're using only has our two schools in it, but the
      Imagery layer will show most of North America and a little slice of South
      America - if you're curious you can try zooming to the Imagery layer, and
      then use your pan and zoom tools to have a look around.</p>
