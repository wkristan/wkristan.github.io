    <title>Step 1 - Calculating NDVI for November 2011.</title>
  </head>

    <h2>Step 1. Calculate NDVI for November 2011. </h2>
    <p>Our next task is to use NDVI to visualize how the greenness of the
      vegetation changes from the spring to the fall in our area.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>1. For the last two activities, we'll be working with some tools
              that are used for doing various image analysis operations. These
              are all available in the Image Analysis window, which we need to
              open up first.</p>
            <p>Select Windows â†’ Image Analysis from the menu.</p>
            <p>You'll see that when the Image Analysis window open up, it has
              your composite_november_2011.img showing in the file list at the
              top of the window.</p>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="image_analysis_window.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Calculating NDVI is very simple in ArcMap - select the image
            file, and then click on the NDVI button (the little maple leaf).</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="ndvi.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The NDVI_composite_november_2011.img that results looks like this:</p>
    <img style="float:left; padding: 10px" src="ndvi_nov11.png">
    <p>Before you move on to Step 2, spend a little time looking at what kind of
      cover type these colors correspond with. The simplest way to do this is to
      "swipe" the NDVI to reveal the high resolution Imagery layer underneath an
      area of interest.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1. Turn off (by un-checking the box next to) the
            composite_november_2011.img file. In the Image Analysis window,
            select your new NDVI_composite_november_2011.img file, and then
            click on the "Swipe layer" button.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="swipe1.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Now, click and hold anywhere on your NDVI image, and you'll see
            that it removes the NDVI layer from your pointer to the left, or to
            the bottom. Keep holding, and move the pointer around - you'll see
            you can now "swipe" the NDVI image back and forth, to see the
            high-resolution image behind it.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="swipe2.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>We're expecting that NDVI is measuring greenness of vegetation rather
      than finding objects with a green color. We can check this by looking at
      the athletic fields at CSUSM, which should have high NDVI (since they are
      grass fields), and at the football field at MHHS, which should have low
      NDVI (since it's astroturf). You can zoom to the Landmarks layer, and then
      swipe the NDVI layer at each school and see if you get green NDVI pixels
      over the fields at CSUSM, and not green pixels over the field at MHHS.</p>
    <p>Now, do some panning, zooming, and swiping to find features like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open water (the ocean, as well as lakes).</li>
      <li>Large developed areas (like shopping malls).</li>
      <li>Golf courses.</li>
      <li>Undeveloped land (scrub, forest).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not too surprisingly, open water and un-vegetated areas like shopping
      malls have low NDVI, and golf courses have high NDVI. Undeveloped lands
      are variable - some have high NDVI, but some have moderate to low NDVI
      depending on the kind of vegetation. For example, grasses and herbaceous
      annual plants grow fast during the spring rains, but they set seed and die
      back by November; any grassland areas will have low NDVI in the fall. On
      the other hand, shrubs and trees aren't as green at the peak of the spring
      growing season, but since they have deeper roots and can reach water
      that's below the surface they will have higher NDVI in the fall than
      grasses.</p>
    <p>In the next step we will repeat this NDVI calculation procedure for an
      image recorded in April 2011, during the rainy season.</p>
