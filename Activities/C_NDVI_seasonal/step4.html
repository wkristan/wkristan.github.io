    <h2>Step 4. Interpret the image. </h2>
    <p>Let's see what's going on with those colors in your NDVI composite. </p>
    <p>We've assigned April and November NDVI values to color channels, so let's
      look at what colors will result from various combinations of high or low
      NDVI in each month. The table below gives several possible patterns of
      high or low NDVI in April and November. Remember that we assigned November
      NDVI to both red and blue channels, so the first and third numbers are
      always the same in the Example RGB code column. The Color column shows the
      color produced by the example RGB code. Finally, an example of the kind of
      land cover that would show this seasonal pattern of change in greenness is
      given in the last column. </p>

    <p>You can use these colors as a guide to try to pick out areas with each
      pattern of NDVI in April and November. There will be lots more shades of
      gray, green, and purple on the map than these, so as you're looking over
      the map there are a couple of basic principles to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the April and November greenness are the same, you will get a shade
        of gray (at the extremes, NDVI of 0,0,0 gives black, and 255,255,255
        gives white, and any set of three identical numbers will give a shade of
        gray).</li>
      <li>If the April NDVI is higher than November, you will get a greenish
        color. The lower the numbers the darker the green will be. The more
        different the April NDVI is from the November NDVI, the more intense the
        green color will be.</li>
      <li>If the November NDVI is higher than April, you will get a shade of
        purple. The lower the numbers the darker the purple will be. The more
        different the November NDVI is from the April NDVI, the more intense the
        purple color will be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that you have the basic pattern in mind, look for examples of each.
      Specifically, see if you can find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Golf course - is it white, as the table above says it should be?</li>
      <li>Undeveloped vegetation - is it a shade of green, as the table above
        says it should be?</li>
      <li>Agricultural fields - what color(s) are they? Why might fields that
        are right next to each other have really different colors?</li>
      <li>Housing development - why might vegetation be even greener in November
        than in April in a housing area? Hint: when do people regularly water
        their yards?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember that you can swipe the NDVI composite to reveal the
      high-definition Imagery layer to double-check what you're looking at.</p>
    <p>That's it for this activity. If you're done early...</p>
    <p> Pan and zoom around and use the high resolution Imagery layer to find
      some undeveloped grasslands, and some undeveloped shrubby vegetation. See
      if you can see the differences in NDVI between grasslands and the woody
      shrub vegetation. Are grasslands more seasonal than shrubby areas?</p>
