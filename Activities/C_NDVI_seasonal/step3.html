    <h2>Step 3. Make and NDVI composite. </h2>
    <p>We can now make a composite of the April and November NDVI layers.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Step 1. Select both of the NDVI images in the Image Analysis
            window. To do this, click on NDVI_composite_april_2011.img, then
            hold down the CTRL key while you click on
            NDVI_composite_november_2011.img. It doesn't matter whether the
            boxes are checked, by the way, you just need both images selected
            for this to work.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="select_ndvi_for_comp.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Step 2. Click on the Composite button in the Image Analysis
            window. This will combine the NDVI bands into a single image with
            two layers. The first in the list (April) becomes Layer_1, and the
            second (November) becomes Layer_2 in the composite.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="composite_ndvi.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Step 3. Assign April 2011 (Layer_1) to Green, and assign November
            2011 (Layer_2) to <em><strong>both</strong></em> Red and Blue.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source src="reassign_layers_ndvi.mp4"> </video>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Your map should look like this:</p>
    <img alt="NDVI composite" src="seasonal_ndvi.png"><br>
    <p>Which looks decidedly strange, right? In the next step we'll unpack what
      the colors are actually telling you about changes in NDVI between wet and
      dry seasons.</p>
