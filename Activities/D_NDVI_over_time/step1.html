    <h2>Step 1 - Load the Spring images for 1984, 1996, and 2011.</h2>
    Since we are coming back from lunch you will be logging in and starting from
    scratch with a new map - there isn't anything new to learn, but you will
    need to log in, start up ArcMap, and load the images you need. The links for
    each step give animations showing how to accomplish each step if you've
    forgotten.
    <p>1. Log in and start up ArcMap.</p>
    <p>2. Click the "Add Data" button and navigate to the Activity4 folder. <a
        title="Add layers" href="add_layers.mp4">Add all three LandSat images in
        the folder</a>. You can select all three layers by holding down the
      SHIFT key while you click on them, or by dragging a box around them. Wait
      to add World_Imagery until step 4.</p>
    <p>3. Put the three years in order in the <a href="put_in_order.mp4">Table
        of Contents</a> - drag the composite_april_1996.img so that it's in
      between composite_march_1984.img and composite_april_2011.img. Note that
      we have an image for March of 1984 instead of April - this is because the
      April image in 1984 had extensive cloud cover. March is also in the middle
      of the growing season, so it is comparable to the two April images.</p>
    <p>4. Add the World_Imagery file, and <a href="add_world_imagery.mp4">drag
        it to the bottom of the Table of Contents</a> - you will use this later
      to help you identify features on the ground, but you want it behind all
      the other layers.</p>
    <p>Next we are going to calculate NDVI for each year, so don't worry about
      the color assignment in your LandSat images - on to Step 2.</p>
