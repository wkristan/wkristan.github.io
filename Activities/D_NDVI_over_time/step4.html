    <h2>Step 4 - Interpreting the colors as patterns of change over time.</h2>
    <p>Just like our comparison of April 2011 to November 2011, we are going to
      interpret color as a pattern of change over time, but now the change is
      over years rather than between seasons. Since 1984 NDVI is assigned to
      Red, 1996 NDVI is assigned to Green, and 2011 NDVI is assigned to Blue,
      our map could have any of the more than 16 million RGB colors on it, but
      you can use this table to give you some guidance about interpreting the
      colors in terms of patterns of change in NDVI.</p>

    <p>Fire is a part of our ecosystems, and after a fire land will be
      un-vegetated. However, vegetation usually re-grows after fire, so low NDVI
      due to a fire should be temporary.</p>
    <p>Permanent loss of habitat happens because of human development. The two
      colors that are most likely to indicate permanent development are thus
      shades of red or yellow.</p>
    <p>Development before 1984 is hard to judge for sure from the colors in this
      composite, but would most likely show as white, black, or a shade of gray.
      White areas will usually be golf courses or other large, irrigated lawns.
      Black areas that are not water bodies will generally be roads or
      extensively paved urban areas, like shopping malls. Intermediate shades of
      gray are harder to interpret - they could be older housing areas with
      mature landscaping, or they could be vegetated areas that have stayed the
      same vegetation type for the whole period. Look at some white, black, and
      gray areas and see if you can figure out what they are now to help you see
      what the color indicates (for example, a gray area that is currently
      vegetated has probably been vegetated consistently since 1984).</p>
    <p>Pan, zoom, and swipe your way around the image looking for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reds and yellows. See how often these are housing developments.</li>
      <li>Whites and blacks. See how often these are golf courses or paved
        areas, respectively.</li>
      <li>The color for the housing development where you live. See if your
        house was here before 1984, was built between 1984 and 1996, or was
        built between 1996 and 2011.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should also look at the map as a whole and get an impression of how
      much development has happened in this 27 year period - how much red and
      yellow is there on the map? How much black and white? Think about this
      both in terms of reduction in the amount of habitat, and in terms of
      breaking up patches of habitat into smaller pieces (that is, habitat
      fragmentation).</p>
    That's it for the activities - we will finish up with some discussion before
    you head back to MHHS.<br>
