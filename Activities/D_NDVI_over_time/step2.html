    <h2>Step 2 - Calculate NDVI for all three years.</h2>
    <p>Now we just need to calculate NDVI for each year as a measure of
      vegetated cover. It will make your life easier in the next step if you do
      them in the order specified below. You've done this a couple of times
      already, but if you forgot what to do click on the links for an animation
      showing the operations.</p>
    <p>1. Open the <a href="open_image_analysis.mp4">Image Analysis</a> window.</p>
    <p>2. Select composite_april_2011.img and calculate NDVI by <a href="ndvi_11.mp4">clicking
        the NDVI button</a> in the Image Analysis window.</p>
    <p>3. Calculate NDVI for <a href="ndvi_96.mp4">composite_april_1996.img</a>.</p>
    <p>4. Calculate NDVI for <a href="ndvi_84.mp4">composite_march_1984.img</a>.</p>
    <p>5. If you did the steps in order, you should see the three NDVI images in
      order from 1984 to 1996 to 2011 in the Image Analysis window. If the NDVI
      images are out of order, then drag them around in the Table of Contents.</p>
    <p>Now on to Step 3 to make a color composite of the three NDVI layers.<br>
