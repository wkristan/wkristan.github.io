    <h2>Step 3 - color infrared images and "false color"</h2>
    <p>Now we can start assigning invisible bands to channels so that we can see
      what these invisible wavelengths have to show us about features on the
      ground.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1. We'll start off with a classic "color infrared" image, in which
            we assign the near infrared band to the red channel. To do this,
            click on the Red channel and assign Layer_4 to it.</td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="false_432.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>You'll see that the image no longer looks natural at all, like this:</p>
    <img alt="Color infrared" src="color_infrared.png">
    <p>Instead of shades of green dominating the image like we got with the
      natural color image, we're seeing shades of red instead. To get a really
      brilliant, bright red color the pixel has to have a near infrared
      reflectance near its maximum value (which is 255), and be near the minimum
      (which is 0) in the other two bands. Areas that are darker, more muted
      shades of red still have a greater amount of infrared radiation reflecting
      off the ground than green or blue light, but all three of the bands are at
      intermediate levels between 0 and 255.</p>
    <p>You can confirm that this is the case using the "Identify" tool.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Select the "Identify" tool, and then click on pixels with
            different colors. <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Find one that is nearly white and confirm that it has big
                numbers for Red, Green, and Blue.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Find one that is nearly black, and confirm that it has low
                numbers for Red, Green, and Blue.</li>
              <li>Find one that is bright red, and confirm it's high for Red,
                but low for Green and Blue.</li>
              <li>Find one that is darker red, and confirm it's highest on Red,
                but with moderate values for all three colors.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td><video style="float:left; padding: 10px" controls="controls"> <source
                src="identify.mp4"> </video> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Why is this useful? Because green, actively growing plants tends to
      reflect more strongly in the near infrared part of the spectrum than dead
      or dormant plants do. Color infrared images show this distinction much
      more clearly than a natural color image can - we can thus use color
      infrared images to not only find where the vegetated areas are, we can
      also tell healthy vegetation from less healthy vegetation.</p>
    <p>And, since we're getting this information from LandSat satellites, we can
      see how the vegetation is doing over large areas, about once per month.</p>
    <p>Color infrared is a very useful false color image type, but it's just one
      possibility. Move on to Step 4 to try out a couple more.</p>
