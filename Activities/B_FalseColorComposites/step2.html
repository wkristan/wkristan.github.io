    <h2>Step 2. Bands, layers, and channels. </h2>
    <p>The layers in our LandSat image are:</p>
    <table style="width: 743px; height: 245px;" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td align="center">Layer number</td>
          <td align="center">Wavelength band (Âµm)</td>

        <tr>

    <p>Currently, the monitor's Red channel is displaying the image's Layer_1,
      the monitor's Green channel is displaying Layer_2, and the monitor's Blue
      channel is displaying Layer_3. Basically, ArcMap just assigned the layers
      to channels in numeric order.</p>
    <p>But, if you look at the table of bands in our image (above) you'll see
      that while Layer_2 is green visible light and is correctly assigned,
      Layer_3 and Layer_1 are backward - Layer_3 is actually red visible light,
      and Layer_1 is blue visible light. If you look at the image, this
      mis-assignment of layers to channels gives us colors that are all messed
      up. We can fix it.</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>1. To make a natural color image, we need to assign Layer_3 to
              Red, and Layer_1 to Blue. Like in the animation to the right,
              click on the Red channel and select Layer_3, and click on the Blue
              channel and select Layer_1. Green is already assigned correctly,
              so no need to change it.</p>
            <p>You now have a natural color image, which looks like a photograph
              taken from space (because that's basically what it is).</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Try some panning and zooming, and
      see if you can identify some features on the image. If you turn the
      composite_november_2011.img on and off you can see the high resolution
      imagery behind it, which will help you confirm that you're seeing what you
      think you're seeing. Try to find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A golf course.</li>
      <li>A lake or pond.</li>
      <li>An undeveloped area with vegetation.</li>
      <li>An active development, with the vegetation removed but without houses
        on it yet.</li>
      <li>Your house.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before you move on to the next step, you can right-click on the
      composite_november_2011.img image and "zoom to layer".</p>
