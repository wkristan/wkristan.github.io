    <h2>Step 4 - Try some more false color images </h2>
    <p>There are several other commonly used false color images that are good
      for different purposes, three of which are listed here:</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Layer assignment - assign these layer numbers to the R,G,B
            channels</td>
          <td>Appearance and uses</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7,4,2</td>
          <td>Better at penetrating atmospheric particles and smoke than natural
            color. Developed areas are light grays and blue-grays, vegetation is
            shades of browns, greens, and oranges. Good for distinguishing
            between wet and dry areas.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4,5,3</td>
          <td>Clearly shows the edges between land and bodies of water.
            Different vegetation types (forests, grasslands, chaparral) are
            different shades of browns, greens, and oranges.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5,4,1</td>
          <td>Similar to 7,4,2, but more useful for distinguishing different
            crop types in agricultural studies.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Try out these three assignments, and see what they look like. You can
      re-visit the areas you were looking at for your color infrared image and
      see how they look now that you are using different invisible bands.</p>
    <p>That's it for the second activity, but if you're done early...try out
      some other assignments, and see what they look like. Since we can't see
      bands 4, 5, or 7 it might be interesting to see what the world looks like
      with just those invisible bands.</p>
