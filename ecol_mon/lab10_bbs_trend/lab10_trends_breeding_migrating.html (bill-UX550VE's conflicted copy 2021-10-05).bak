    <h1>Trend assessment - breeding birds, and migrating birds</h1>
    <p>We will be looking at trends in numbers of a set of birds of prey, using
      the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), as well as counts done at Hawk Mountain,
      PA during the Fall migration (which we'll call the HM data).</p>
    <p>The two data sets are relatively long-term. BBS began in 1966, and
      focuses on counts of birds during the breeding season. BBS data is
      collected from throughout North America, but with densities of routes
      being related to human population density. The Hawk Mountain data records
      raptors during their Fall migration, and the counts are done from a single
      location. However, since the Appalachian Flyway, a major travel route for
      migrating birds along the East Coast, goes right over Hawk Mountain,
      raptors from all over eastern North America pass by that one location.
      Counts have been done annually since 1934.</p>
    <p>Raptors are carnivores, and as such were one of the groups of birds most
      strongly affected by DDT, an insecticide used from the World War II era
      through its eventual banning in the US in 1972 (although it was not banned
      worldwide until 2001). DDT is a persistent, fat-soluble chemical that
      enters the food chain, and bio-magnifies, meaning that its concentration
      increases as it moves up to higher trophic levels. Top predators thus
      would have massively higher concentrations in their tissues than the
      concentration applied in the environment. DDT was thought to be non-toxic
      to vertebrates, but it was found that at this very high concentrations it
      leads to eggshell thinning and reproductive failure in birds. Several
      species, including the Bald Eagle, ended up listed as Endangered Species
      primarily due to DDT.</p>
    <p>BBS data can be downloaded for analysis, but there are statistical issues
      that need to be accounted for that go beyond what we will be addressing in
      this class. However, the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has
      developed a web-based analysis platform that we can make use of.</p>
    <p>Our goal for today, then, is to use the BBS web site to analyze trends in
      a selection of raptors in eastern North America, and then conduct our own
      analysis of Hawk Mountain data on the same species. We will see whether
      counts of breeding and migrating birds tend to tell us the same thing, or
      whether they indicate different trends in these species.</p>
    <p>The species we will use are <a class="tooltip">Osprey<span class="tooltiptext"><img
            src="osprey.jpeg" style="width: 300px"></span></a>, <a class="tooltip">Bald
        eagle<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="bald-eagle_lorie-shaull.png" style="width: 300px"></span></a>,

            style="width: 300px"></span></a>.</p>
    <h2>BBS instructions</h2>
    <p>We will keep this section short and sweet - follow <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/">this
        link</a> to the Breeding Bird Survey's regional trend analysis page.
      Scroll down to the "Survey Results" section, and then select "Trend
      Estimates" that are conducted <em><strong>by species</strong></em>. </p>
    <p>Download <a href="hawks.xlsx">this</a> file to your S: drive, and open
      it in Excel. You'll see that it's an Excel spreadsheet with one worksheet
      called "BBS", followed by a different worksheet for each species with data
      from the Hawk Mountain counts, and one final one for import into R - we'll
      get to those next, first switch to the BBS worksheet.</p>
    <p>Find the first species, Osprey, in the drop-down menu of species (they
      are listed in a taxonomic order instead of alphabetically, so you may have
      to search around a little). You'll see that there are two trends listed
      for each area: one for the entire BBS period (1966 to 2015) and one for
      the most recent 22 years of data (1993-2015). Find the Eastern BBS Region
      (near the bottom of the list), and record the trend estimate, the lower
      limit and upper limit for confidence interval in your worksheet (you don't
      need to record the RA score, this is a measure of relative abundance of
      the species relative to other species in the area, which isn't relevant to
      us).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For the 1993-2015 estimate, enter whether the trend estimate indicates an
      increasing population, a decreasing population, or a stable population
      (column E). The trend estimates are changes in number of birds counted per
      year, and the confidence interval will tell you whether you can consider
      the trend to be different from zero; if the confidence interval includes
      zero, consider the population stable. If the confidence interval does not
      include zero, and the trend estimate is positive, then it's an increasing
      population. If the confidence interval does not include zero, and the
      trend estimate is negative, then it's a decreasing population.</p>
    <p>Repeat the increase, decrease, or stable designation for the 1993-2015
      estimates (in column I).</p>
    <p>Now, compare the two conclusions in E and I for each species: If the two
      trend estimates lead to the same conclusion, then enter "no change" in J.
      If there was a shift either from decrease to stable or increase, or from
      stable to increase, then things have been improving lately - enter
      "Accelerating" in column J. If there is a shift from increasing to stable
      or decreasing, or from stable to decreasing, then things have gotten worse
      lately - enter "Decelerating" in column J.</p>
    <p>Repeat this set of steps for the other four species: Bald Eagle, Northern
      Harrier, Red-shouldered Hawk, and Merlin.<a class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext"></span></a></p>
    <p>Now we will do our own analysis of the Hawk Mountain migrating raptor
      data set, and see how it compares to what we see in the BBS counts.</p>
    <h2>Hawk Mountain data</h2>
    <p>We will be analyzing the changes in number of migrating birds counted at
      Hawk Mountain next. The data are collected from an observation point at
      the top of a mountain, and the species is recorded for each bird observed.
      The data were tallied by day between 1935 and 1965, and by hour
      thereafter. The number of days and hours were variable, but the number of
      minutes of observation was recorded for each observation period, so I was
      able to calculate the number seen per minute, multiply that by 60 to
      obtain a number seen per hour, and then average these numbers per hour for
      each year. The data we will work with, then, is the number of birds of
      each species observed per hour of observation for each year.</p>
    <p>With such a long time series we will have the opportunity to see many
      trends that are not simple linear relationships. If you think about it,
      linear relationships can't be common in the long term - species may
      decline linearly for awhile, but will eventually go extinct if they don't
      level off. Species may increase linearly for awhile as well, but they will
      eventually deplete their food source and either stabilize or crash to
      smaller numbers. We will be using non-linear regression to describe the
      changes in numbers over time for each of our species.</p>

            <p>Consider the data to the left for the Red Tailed Hawk. We're
              interested in whether they are stable, increasing, or decreasing
              over time, and linear regression will give us a slope coefficient
              that will address that. So let's see what a simple linear
              regression looks like.</p>

            <p>Based on this linear regression there does seem to be a decline
              in RTHA over time, but notice that the line doesn't fit the data
              very well. There is a marked decline to about 1950, with an
              increase after about 1960, to a peak at about 1975, with a decline
              after that. A straight line with a single slope is simple and easy
              to interpret, but if it doesn't describe the data well we
              shouldn't try to interpret it.</p>
            <p>Think of a straight line is a first-order polynomial - a slope
              multiplied by x raised to the power of 1, RTHA = b + m(year<sup>1</sup>).
              The next highest would be a second-order polynomial, which is also
              called a quadratic function, so let's try fitting a second-order
              polynomial to these data.</p>

            <p>First, the fact that the line (mostly) goes through the middle of
              the data is a good sign that this is a good description of the
              data. We can augment this impression with plots of residuals, like
              the residual vs. predicted plot on the left, and the histogram of
              residuals on the right.</p>
          </td>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The other thing we can do is to compare the different models against each
      other to see whether we are doing a better job of characterizing the data
      by adding higher order terms - this type of comparison is done by
      comparing the unexplained variation in two models. This type of comparison
      is only statistically valid if one of the models is a subset of the other.
      If you look at the formulas for the fifth and fourth-order models, the
      fourth only has terms that are in the fifth, but the fifth has just one
      extra. That means the fourth order model is a subset of (or "nested"
      within) the fifth. If we compare them we would find that we don't have
      significantly more variation explained by the model with the fifth order
      term (p = 0.3591).</p>
    <p>But, look at the graphs above - the fourth-order model has a dramatic
      up-swing in the last few years of the data, but the data doesn't show such
      a pattern. The line is the "best fit" fourth order polynomial across the
      entire data set, but it's not fitting well in the last few years, which
      (from a management perspective) are very important. This is one of the
      downsides of using polynomial regression - the function imposes a shape to
      the line that may not be well supported by the data, so it's important to
      make sure the line fits the data well. We will stick with the fifth-order
      model because of its better fit in the last decade or so of the data set.
      This is a very high-order polynomial to use, by the way - beyond about 4th
      or 5th order the equations become very complex, but without dramatically
      improving the fit of the model to the data. At the extreme, with 74 years
      of data we could fit a line that hit every single data point perfectly
      with a 73rd-order polynomial, but it would be useless for understanding
      the general trend in a mean number of birds over time, with random
      variation around it.</p>

          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Once we have a line that fits the data well, we can use it to
              address how RTHA have changed over time. With a complex pattern of
              change like we're seeing for RTHA there isn't a single rate of
              change that describes the data. We do get coefficients for each of
              the terms in the model, but they are constants, and don't tell us
              what is happening at any given year.</p>
            <p>Instead, the rate of change at any year is a tangent line to the
              curve at that year. For example, in 1940 the tangent line (in red)
              has a strongly negative slope, but by 1967 (in blue) it's
              moderately positive. We can calculate the slopes of these tangent
              lines at any year of interest using the first derivative of the
              function.</p>

    <p>With polynomials, derivatives are easy to calculate - you drop the
      constant (b), and multiply the coefficients (m's) by the exponents, and
      then subtract 1 from the exponents.</p>
    <p>So, with our fifth-order polynomial, the equation was:</p>
    <p>RTHA = b + m<sub>1</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>)
      + m<sub>3</sub>(year<sup>3</sup>) + m<sub>4</sub>(year<sup>4</sup>) + m<sub>5</sub>(year<sup>5</sup>)</p>
    <p>And the first derivative with respect to year, d(RTHA)/d(Year), is: </p>
    <p>m<sub>1</sub> + 2m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + 3m<sub>3</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>)

    <p>Okay, now with that background, let's analyze some hawk data.</p>
    <h3>Trends in the Hawk Mountain data</h3>
    <p>1. <strong>Plot the first species change over time</strong>. Switch to
      the first sheet of Hawk Mountain data, Osprey. You'll see that Year is
      expressed from 0 to 73, instead of giving the actual years (1934 to 2010)
      - we need to do this to make it possible to estimate the higher-order
      terms (to work with a fifth-order term you have to raise year to the fifth
      power, and if we raise 2010 to the fifth power we get numbers that Excel
      can't handle).</p>
    <p>Select the data, including the column headings (A2 through B75), and
      insert a scatter plot. Make sure it's a scatter plot, and not a line plot
      with just plot symbols.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Add trend lines</strong>. Select the data by clicking once on
      the dots. Click on the + (Chart Elements) and select "Trendline" →
      "Linear", which will add a linear regression line to the graph. You'll see
      it doesn't fit very well, as there seems to be an increase in osprey in
      the first several decades, but then the numbers level off in the 1980's,
      around year 45. Because of this the "best fit" line over-shoots in the
      early and later part of the series, and under-shoots in the middle years.</p>
    <p>Check the box next to "Display R-squared value on chart" - this is the
      proportion of the total SS that is explained by the line (we'll use this
      later).</p>
    <p>We can add a polynomial line next - add a trendline again, but this time
      select "More options", and in the "Format Trendline" window that opens up
      you can select a "Polynomial" trend line. Initially it will be of order 2,
      so it will characterize a parabola. Also have the R-squared reported on
      the chart.</p>
    <p>Switch to the "Fill and Line" settings in the "Format Trendline" window,
      and change the line color to something that's different from the straight
      line, and easy to see.</p>
    <p>Now, back to the "Trendline options" where you started - you can try out
      polynomials of different order by increasing the number. Try 3, 4, and 5.
      You'll see that going to 3 changes the shape a little - it flattens out
      the early part of the curve and makes it peak more sharply in the late
      1990's. After that increasing the order of the polynomial barely changes
      the shape of the line - this is a pretty good indication that these
      higher-order terms aren't helping to describe the pattern of change.</p>
    <p>Next we will learn how to test whether adding a term significantly
      improves the fit of the line to the data.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Test for an increase in fit as you add higher-order terms</strong>.
      We are going to build a table that tests whether the quadratic fits better
      than the linear, whether the cubic fits better than the quadratic, whether
      the fourth order fits better than the cubic, and whether the fifth order
      polynomial fits better than the fourth order.</p>
    <p>The basic idea is that we need to know how much additional variation in
      the counts is explained each time we add a higher-order term. If the
      amount is large enough to be statistically significant, we have
      justification for including the term. When we get to a point that adding
      higher-order terms no longer improves the fit, we can stop and interpret
      the simplest model that fits the data well.</p>
    <p>Remember from the regression review, we can divide the sums of squares
      for the bird counts into a portion that can be explained by a line through
      the data (the model SS), and a portion that is random, unexplained
      variation (the residual SS). As we go from a straight line to a quadratic
      model, the quadratic will fit the data better by some degree - we can
      calculate the difference in the unexplained, random variation as a measure
      of how much additional variation is explained. We can use this additional
      explained variation in an F test, in which we divide the MS for the
      explained variation by the residual MS. This is very much like the F-test
      we conduced in the ANOVA table we produced for our simple linear
      regressions, but in this case we're testing for significant increases in
      fit by making the model more complex.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell E1 type "Trend", and in E2 type "Linear", in E3 type "Quad",
        and in E4 type "Cubic", E5 type "Fourth", and in E6 type "Fifth".</li>
      <li>Lay out the columns of this table we're building:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell F1 type "Total SS". </li>
        <li>In G1 type "R2" - this will be the R<sup>2</sup> reported by Excel
          for each line.</li>
        <li>In H1 type "Residual df". </li>
        <li>In I1 type "Residual SS".</li>
        <li>In J1 type "Model df".</li>
        <li>In K1 type "Residual diff."</li>
        <li>In L1 type "df diff."</li>
        <li>In M1 type "F"</li>
        <li>In N1 type "p"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Now to calculate the values for the table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Total sums of squares is just the sum of the differences between the
        OSPR data and the mean of the OSPR data. Calculate this in cell F2 as
        =sum((b2:b75-average(b2:b75))^2) - this is an array formula because
        we're calculating a whole column of squared residuals, so use
        CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. <br>
        The total SS is the same for all five models, so enter =f$2 in cell F3,
        and then copy/paste this to cells F4, F5, and F6.</li>
      <li>Record R<sup>2</sup> from the fitted lines. You will have one already
        for the straight line (which goes in G2), and to get the rest set the
        order of the polynomial to 2 and record R<sup>2</sup> in the Quad row
        (G3). Then set the order to 3 and record the R<sup>2</sup> for the Cubic
        row, and so on to the fifth-order polynomial.</li>
      <li>Residual df is total df - model df, so let's enter the model df first.
        Model df is:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 for the linear regression - enter a 1 in J2. This is true for
          liner regression in general, one df is assigned to the slope estimate.</li>
        <li>2 for quadratic regreesion - enter a 2 in J3.</li>
        <li>3 for cubic regression - enter a 3 in J4.</li>
        <li>4 for fourth order - enter a 4 in J5.</li>
        <li>5 for fifth order - enter a 5 in J6.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now to enter residual df. Residual df is total df - model df. Since
        total df is sample size - 1, we have a total df of 73 for each model.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For residual df for the Linear model, in cell H2, enter the formula
          =73 - j2.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste this formula for quad and cubic (cells H3 to H6).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The residual SS is the random, unexplained variation. We don't have an
        ANOVA table to get this from, but we can calculate it from the total SS
        and the model R<sup>2</sup>. For example, an R<sup>2</sup> for 0.3873
        for the straight line means that 38.73% of the variation in Osprey
        counts is explained by the line - the implication is that 1-0.3873 =
        0.6127, or 61.27% is not explained. The variation that is not explained
        is the residual SS. So, to calculate residual SS for the straight line,
        in cell I2 type =f2*(1-g2). Copy and paste this formula to the rest of
        the cells to get residual SS for the other four models.</li>
      <li>The differences in residual SS next - these are differences between
        adjacent rows. Adding terms <strong>must always reduce</strong> the
        residual SS, so we need to subtract the residuals for the less-complex
        model from the more-complex model; enter the formula =i2-i3 in cell K3
        (put it in the Quad row, because this is measuring whether we improved
        fit by adding the quadratic term). Copy and paste this to the rest of
        the cells to get the reduction in residual SS from adding each term to
        the model.</li>
      <li>Calculate the difference in df between the models - in cell L3 type
        =h3-h2, and copy/paste to the rest of the rows (it should be 1 for each
        row).</li>
      <li>Now we're ready for the F tests.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell M3 enter the formula =(k3/l3)/(i3/h3). This calculates an MS
          for the extra variation explained when we added the quad term (k3/l3),
          and divides it by a residual MS (i3/h3). Copy and paste this to cell
          to the rest of the rows to get F ratios for each added term.</li>
        <li>In cell N3 enter the formula =fdist(m3,l3,h3) - this will give you a
          p-value for the F ratio in cell M3, given the numerator df in L3, and
          the denominator df in H3. Copy and paste this to the rest of the rows
          to get p-values for the rest of the added terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on these calculations, we significantly increased the explained
      variation when we added the quad term, but not when we added the cubic
      term, the fourth-order, or fifth-order terms. Consequently, we'll base our
      interpretations on the quadratic model. Select everything in the Quad
      line, and hit CTRL+I, then CTRL+B to italicize and bold the characters for
      the model you will be interpreting.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Calculate the coefficients for the first derivative</strong>.
      Now we want to know what the change in Osprey count per year is, at any
      given year. We need to calculate the first derivative of the quadratic to
      do this - it sounds hard, but it's actually not.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell E8 type "Coefficients", and in E9 type "m2". In F9 type "m1",
        and in G9 type "b". With a quadratic relationship we'll have an
        intercept (b), a linear coefficient (m1), and a quadratic coefficient
        (m2), so we need spaces for all three.</li>
      <li>Select all three cells below your labels, E10 through G10.</li>
      <li>We are going to use the linest() function, short for "line
        estimation", to get the coefficients for that quadratic line in our
        graph. Without changing the selected cells, type the function:<br>
        <br>
        =linest(b2:b75, a2:a75^{1,2},TRUE,FALSE) <br>
        <br>
        and then CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array formula. <br>
        <br>
        This function is estimating the line, using the known y-data (b2:b75),
        and the known x-data (a2:a75). Raising the x-data to the power of 1 and
        2 (in the curly braces) tells linest() to use both the first and second
        order terms, which gives us a quadratic fit. The last two are options
        for whether we want to estimate the intercept (we do, so it's set to
        TRUE), and whether we want some additional regression statistics (we
        don't, so it's set to "FALSE"). As an array formula it returns the
        coefficients into the cells you selected, so we get all three
        coefficients at once. Note that all three of the output cells are part
        of the array formula - you can't change E10, F10, or G10 by themselves
        anymore, you have to select all three and edit the array formula for the
        entire set.</li>
      <li>Now that you know the coefficients, you can calculate the first
        derivative:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell E12 type "Derivative"</li>
        <li>In cell E13 type "m1"</li>
        <li>In cell F13 type "b"</li>
        <li>In cell E14 type the formula =2*e10. This is the exponent (2) on the
          quadratic term multiplied by the coefficient for the quadratic term
          (e10).</li>
        <li>In cell F14 use the formula =f10. This is the coefficient for the
          linear term (i.e. the slope) for our quadratic line, which becomes the
          constant (i.e. the intercept) for the derivative.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>5. <strong>Calculate the rate of change each year</strong>. You may
      already know that the first derivative of a parabola is a straight line,
      and sure enough we now have a constant and a slope to multiply by year for
      our first derivative, which makes it a straight line.</p>
    <p>In cell C1 type "Rate of change", and in cell C2 type =f$14+e$14*a2. Copy
      and paste this to the rest of the years. You'll see that the rate of
      change was positive until about 1990, when Osprey started declining.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Plot the rates of change</strong>. Select the years and the
      rates of change, and insert a scatter plot with only connecting lines and
      no plot symbols. Title it "Rates of change in Osprey counts".</p>
    <p>7. <strong>Repeat</strong>. Now you can repeat this for the other four
      species. Specifically, for each species:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plot the counts per hour vs. year for each species.</li>
      <li>Try out polynomials as high as 5. Test whether each added term is
        significant.</li>
      <li>Pick the highest order model to interpret.</li>
      <li>Calculate the coefficients of the model (with linest()).</li>
      <li>Calculate the coefficients for the first derivative.</li>
      <li>Calculate the rate of change for each year.</li>
      <li>Plot the rate of change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A couple of hints...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The set of tests of each term (Linear, Quad, Cubic, Fourth, and Fifth)
        is copy and paste-able for all of the species (just make sure you paste
        to the same cells in each worksheet). All you need to do is enter the
        new R<sup>2</sup> values for the curve fits.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>You will need a fourth order polynomial for Bald Eagles. The linest()
        and derivative calculation steps are a little different:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate coefficients up to m4 when you do linest(). Start with m4
          in cell E9, and work your way down to b in cell I9. When you do the
          linest() command, select all of the cells from e10:i10, and make sure
          you raise the known x's to the power of {1,2,3,4}.</li>
        <li>The derivative coefficients will now go up to m3 - enter m3 into
          cell E15, and work your way down to b. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>In cell E14 multiply the coefficient in e10 by 4</li>
          <li>In cell F14 multiply the coefficient in f10 by 3</li>
          <li>In cell G14 multiply the coefficient in g10 by 2</li>
          <li>H16 will just be the coefficient in H10.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When you calculate the rate of change, you will multiply the
          coefficient in E14 by year raised to the power of 3, the coefficient
          in F14 by year raised to the power of 2....like so:<br>
          =E$14*A2^3+F$14*A2^2+G$14*A2+H$14<br>
          This can then be copied and pasted for the rest of the years.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You can copy and paste the Osprey coefficients, derivatives, and rates
        of change to any bird with a second-order polynomial fit, and the Bald
        Eagle coefficients, derivatives, and rates of change to any bird with a
        fourth-order polynomial fit. All of the species are one or the other.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you're done, make sure you can interpret the rates of change graph -
      which years show increases, which show decreases, and in which were they
      stable?</p>
    <p>Also look at how the trends compare for breeding birds and migrating
      birds - year 32 is 1966, and year 76 is 2010, so are the rates of change
      you're seeing for those time periods in agreement with the BBS trends?
      Note that the units are different on the BBS data - they are numbers of
      individual seen per route surveyed. When comparing the, focus on the sign
      on the trend, and whether the trends were different for recent counts than
      overall for each species.</p>
    <h2>Optional for Biol 420, required for 620 - do the Osprey analysis in R</h2>
    <p>Download this <a href="hawks.Rmd">Rmd</a> file to the same folder the
      hawks.xlsx file is in, start R Studio, and make a new project from an
      existing folder using the folder with the data and Rmd file in it. Open
      the Rmd file and follow the instructions. For this kind of statistical
      analysis you'll see R is actually much quicker and easier to use (you have
      to know a little more about what you're doing to make the graphs work, but
      comparing the model fits is much easier). Do the Osprey trend analysis,
      and then feel free to do other species if you want the practice.</p>
