    <h1>Trend assessment - breeding birds, and migrating birds</h1>
    <p>We will be looking at trends in counts of a set of birds of prey, using two different monitoring programs: the
      Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and Hawk Mountain's annual migrating hawk counts.</p>
    <p>Both data sets we will work with are relatively long-term. BBS began in 1966, and focuses on counts of birds
      during the breeding season. BBS data are collected from throughout North America, but with densities of routes
      being related to human population density. The Hawk Mountain data records raptors during their Fall migration, and
      the counts are done from a single location. However, since the Appalachian Flyway, a major travel route for
      migrating birds along the East Coast, goes right over Hawk Mountain, PA, raptors from all over eastern North
      America pass by that one location. Counts have been done at HM annually since 1934, every year except for
      1942-1944, when they took a break to fight World War II. There are thus a total of 74 counts conducted over 76
      years.</p>
    <p>Raptors are carnivores, and as such were one of the groups of birds most strongly affected by DDT, an insecticide
      used from the World War II era through its eventual banning in the US in 1972 (although it was not banned
      worldwide until 2001). DDT is a persistent, fat-soluble chemical that enters the food chain, and bio-magnifies,
      meaning that its concentration increases as it moves up to higher trophic levels. Top predators thus would have
      massively higher concentrations in their tissues than the concentration applied in the environment. DDT was
      thought to be non-toxic to vertebrates, but it was found that at this very high concentrations it leads to
      eggshell thinning and reproductive failure in birds. Several species, including the Bald Eagle, ended up listed as
      Endangered Species primarily due to DDT.</p>
    <p>BBS data can be downloaded for analysis, but there are statistical issues that need to be accounted for that go
      beyond what we will be addressing in this class. However, the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has developed
      a web-based analysis platform that we can make use of.</p>
    <p>Our goal for today, then, is to use the BBS web site to analyze trends in a selection of raptors in eastern North
      America, and then conduct our own analysis of Hawk Mountain data on the same species. We will see whether counts
      of breeding and migrating birds tend to tell us the same thing, or whether they indicate different trends in these
      species.</p>
    <p>The species we will use are <a class="tooltip">Osprey<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="osprey.jpeg" style="width: 300px"></span></a>,
      <a class="tooltip">Bald eagle<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="bald-eagle_lorie-shaull.png" style="width: 300px"></span></a>,
      <a class="tooltip">Northern Harrier<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="nohaGL.jpg" style="width: 300px"></span></a>,

    <h2>BBS instructions</h2>
    <p>We will keep this section short and sweet - follow <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/">this
        link</a> to the Breeding Bird Survey's regional trend analysis page. Scroll down to the "Survey Results"
      section, and then select "Trend Estimates" that are conducted <em><strong>by species</strong></em>. </p>
    <p>Download <a href="hawks.xlsx">this</a> file to your S: drive, and open it in Excel. You'll see that it's an
      Excel spreadsheet with one worksheet called "BBS", followed by a different worksheet for each species with data
      from the Hawk Mountain counts, and one final one for import into R - we'll get to those next, first switch to the
      BBS worksheet.</p>
    <p>Find the first species, Osprey, in the drop-down menu of species (they are listed in a taxonomic order instead of
      alphabetically, so you may have to search around a little). You'll see that there are two trends listed for each
      area: one for the entire BBS period (1966 to 2015) and one for the most recent 22 years of data (1993-2015). Find
      the Eastern BBS Region (near the bottom of the list), and record the trend estimate, the lower limit and upper
      limit for confidence interval in your worksheet (you don't need to record the RA score, this is a measure of
      relative abundance of the species relative to other species in the area, which isn't relevant to us).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For the 1993-2015 estimate, enter whether the trend estimate indicates an increasing population, a decreasing
      population, or a stable population (column E). The trend estimates are changes in number of birds counted per
      year, and the confidence interval will tell you whether you can consider the trend to be different from zero; if
      the confidence interval includes zero, consider the population stable. If the confidence interval does not include
      zero, and the trend estimate is positive, then it's an increasing population. If the confidence interval does not
      include zero, and the trend estimate is negative, then it's a decreasing population.</p>
    <p>Repeat the increase, decrease, or stable designation for the 1993-2015 estimates (in column I).</p>
    <p>Now, compare the two conclusions in E and I for each species: If the two trend estimates lead to the same
      conclusion, then enter "no change" in J. If there was a shift either from decrease to stable or increase, or from
      stable to increase, then things have been improving lately - enter "Accelerating" in column J. If there is a shift
      from increasing to stable or decreasing, or from stable to decreasing, then things have gotten worse lately -
      enter "Decelerating" in column J.</p>
    <p>Repeat this set of steps for the other four species: Bald Eagle, Northern Harrier, Red-shouldered Hawk, and
      Merlin.<a class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext"></span></a></p>
    <p>Once the BBS numbers are entered in your Excel file you can move on to analyze the Hawk Mountain migrating raptor
      data set, and see how it compares to what we see in the BBS counts.</p>
    <h2>Hawk Mountain data</h2>
    <p>We will be analyzing the changes in number of migrating birds counted at Hawk Mountain next. The data are
      collected from an observation point at the top of a mountain, and the species is recorded for each bird observed.
      The data were tallied by day between 1934 and 1965, and by hour thereafter. The number of days and hours were
      variable, but the number of minutes of observation was recorded for each observation period, so I was able to
      calculate the number seen per minute, multiply that by 60 to obtain a number seen per hour, and then average these
      numbers per hour for each year. The data we will work with, then, is the mean number of birds of each species
      observed per hour of observation for each year.</p>
    <p>With such a long time series we will have the opportunity to see many trends that are not simple linear
      relationships. If you think about it, linear relationships can't be common in the long term - species may decline
      linearly for awhile, but will eventually go extinct if they don't level off. Species may increase linearly for
      awhile as well, but they will eventually deplete their food source and either stabilize or crash to smaller
      numbers. We will be using non-linear regression to describe the changes in numbers over time for each of our
      species.</p>

            <p>Consider the data to the left for the Red Tailed Hawk. We're interested in whether they are stable,
              increasing, or decreasing over time, and linear regression will give us a slope coefficient that will
              address that. So let's see what a simple linear regression looks like.</p>

          <td><img alt="Linear" src="rtha_linear.png"></td>
          <td>
            <p>Based on this linear regression there does seem to be a decline in RTHA over time, but notice that the
              line doesn't fit the data very well. There is a marked decline to about 1950, with an increase after about
              1960, to a peak at about 1975, with a decline after that. A straight line with a single slope is simple
              and easy to interpret, but if it doesn't describe the data well we shouldn't try to interpret it.</p>
            <p>Think of a straight line is a first-order polynomial - a slope multiplied by x raised to the power of 1,
              RTHA = b + m(year<sup>1</sup>). The next highest would be a second-order polynomial, which is also called
              a quadratic function, so let's try fitting a second-order polynomial to these data.</p>

            <p>Adding a polynomial gives the regression the ability to follow a pattern that is predicted by the
              polynomial. You'll see in the example on the right of three different parabolas that they can point upward
              or downward depending on the sign on the coefficient, and small coefficients make them flatter. The linear
              term has to be kept in the model, but when we add a <strong>quadratic</strong> (i.e. squared, parabolic)
              term we can describe patterns that have an n or u shape. </p>
            <p>This graph may look the same as the straight line above, but it's not. The formula for this line is RTHA
              = b + m<sub>1</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>), but the pattern is not at all a
              parabolic curve, so the coefficient on the year<sup>2</sup> term, m<sub>2</sub>, is nearly zero.</p>

            <p>Cubic functions are like a sideways s-curve - they can rise, fall, and then rise or if we flip them
              around the x-axis they can fall, rise, and then fall (click on the graph to flip it around the x-axis). If
              we just used the middle portion we can have a forward or backward s-curve with a cubic term included
              (click to see the s-curve created from the middle section). </p>
            <p>The cubic added to the formula gives us the graph to the left, and the formula is:</p>
            <p>RTHA = b + m<sub>1</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>) + m<sub>3</sub>(year<sup>3</sup>)</p>
            <p>This is looking better - we've captured the general shape, but are under-shooting the increase in the

            <p>gives us the graph to the left. This too is closer to the data, but the uptick at the very end is a

            <p>How do we know this is the right relationship to use? We can look at a couple of things. </p>
            <p>First, the fact that the line (mostly) goes through the middle of the data is a good sign that this is a
              good description of the data. We can augment this impression with plots of residuals, like the residual
              vs. predicted plot on the left, and the histogram of residuals on the right.</p>
          </td>
          <td><img style="width: 298px; height: 250px;" alt="Histogram" src="std_resid_hist.png"><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The other thing we can do is to compare the different models against each other to see whether we are doing a
      better job of characterizing the data by adding higher order terms - this type of comparison is done by comparing
      the unexplained variation in two models. This type of comparison is only statistically valid if one of the models
      is a subset of the other. If you look at the formulas for the fifth and fourth-order models, the fourth only has
      terms that are in the fifth, but the fifth has just one extra. That means the fourth order model is a subset of
      (or "nested" within) the fifth. If we compare them we would find that we don't have significantly more variation
      explained by the model with the fifth order term (p = 0.3591).</p>
    <p>But, look at the graphs above - the fourth-order model has a dramatic up-swing in the last few years of the data,
      but the data doesn't show such a pattern. The line is the "best fit" fourth order polynomial across the entire
      data set, but it's not fitting well in the last few years, which (from a management perspective) are very
      important. This is one of the downsides of using polynomial regression - the function imposes a shape to the line
      that may not be well supported by the data, so it's important to make sure the line fits the data well. We may
      choose to stick with the fifth-order model because of its better fit in the last decade or so of the data set.
      This is a very high-order polynomial to use, by the way - beyond about 4th or 5th order the equations become very
      complex, but usually high-order polynomials don't dramatically improve the fit of the model to the data. At the
      extreme, with 74 years of data we could fit a line that hit every single data point perfectly with a 73rd-order
      polynomial, but it would be useless for understanding the general trend in a mean number of birds over time, with
      random variation around it.</p>

          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Once we have a line that fits the data well, we can use it to address how RTHA have changed over time.
              With a complex pattern of change like we're seeing for RTHA there isn't a single rate of change that
              describes the data. We do get coefficients for each of the terms in the model, but they are constants, and
              don't tell us what is happening at any given year.</p>
            <p>Instead, the rate of change at any year is a tangent line to the curve at that year. For example, in 1940
              the tangent line (in red) has a strongly negative slope, but by 1967 (in blue) it's moderately positive.
              We can calculate the slopes of these tangent lines at any year of interest using the first derivative of
              the function.</p>

    <p>With polynomials, derivatives are easy to calculate - you drop the constant (b), and multiply the coefficients
      (m's) by the exponents, and then subtract 1 from the exponents.</p>
    <p>So, with our fifth-order polynomial, the equation was:</p>
    <p>RTHA = b + m<sub>1</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>) + m<sub>3</sub>(year<sup>3</sup>) +
      m<sub>4</sub>(year<sup>4</sup>) + m<sub>5</sub>(year<sup>5</sup>)</p>
    <p>And the first derivative with respect to year, d(RTHA)/d(Year), is: </p>
    <p>m<sub>1</sub> + 2m<sub>2</sub>(year<sup>1</sup>) + 3m<sub>3</sub>(year<sup>2</sup>) + 4m<sub>4</sub>(year<sup>3</sup>)

    <p>Okay, now with that background, let's analyze some hawk data.</p>
    <h3>Trends in the Hawk Mountain data</h3>
    <p>1. <strong>Plot the first species change over time</strong>. Switch to the first sheet of Hawk Mountain data,
      Osprey. You'll see that Year is expressed in two ways, as the calendar year (from 1934 to 2010) and as the
      "year.number" from 0 to 76. Year.number is just the number of years since the beginning, and is obtained by
      subtracting 1934 from each Year. We need to do this to make it possible to estimate the higher-order terms (to
      work with a fifth-order term you have to raise year to the fifth power, and if we raise 2010 to the fifth power we
      get numbers that Excel can't handle).</p>
    <p>Select the data for Year.number and OSPR, including the column headings (B2 through C75), and insert a scatter
      plot:</p>
    <video alt="Insert scatter" controls="controls"><source src="insert_scatter.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>Make sure it's a scatter plot, and not a line plot with just plot symbols - line plots treat the x-axis as
      categories, even if the x-axis variable is made up of numbers, and we need the x-axis to be numeric or our
      polynomial regression lines won't be accurate.</p>
    <p>The axes are not labeled by default, so let's fix that - click on the x-axis labels and you'll see three tools
      pop up to the right - click on the + tool to add axis labels, like so:</p>
    <video alt="Axes" controls="controls"><source src="axes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>Change the x-axis label to "Year number" and the y-axis label to "Sightings per hour".</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Add trend lines</strong>. Select the data by clicking once on the dots. Click on the + (Chart
      Elements) and select "Trendline" → "Linear", which will add a linear regression line to the graph.</p>
    <p> You'll see it doesn't fit very well, as there seems to be an increase in osprey in the first several decades,
      but then the numbers level off in the 1980's, around year 45. Because of this the "best fit" line over-shoots in
      the early and later part of the series, and under-shoots in the middle years.</p>
    <p>Next, to get the R-squared and regression equation onto the graph, select the trend line, and then in the
      settings panel on the right side of the spreadsheet, find the boxes for "Display Equation on chart" and "Display
      R-squared value on chart", and check the boxes next to each of them. You can move the box with the equation and R<sup>2</sup>
      to a location you can see them, like so: </p>
    <video alt="R-square equation" controls="controls"><source src="rsq_eqn.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>Note that I made my line thick, red, and solid to make it easier to see, yours may be blue and dotted instead. R<sup>2</sup>
      is useful to us because it is the proportion of the total SS that is explained by the line - we'll use this later
      when we compare the lines against each other in the next steps.</p>
    <p>We can add a polynomial line next - this time, select the dots on the graph, right-click and add a trendline.
      This will give you a second line, but it's sitting right on top of the first. In the "Format Trendline" window
      that opens up you can select a "Polynomial" trend line, and set it to order 2 - this will be a model like the one
      above for RTHA that has both the linear and quadratic terms. Also have the R-squared reported on the chart, and
      move them where you can see them - they aren't labeled as "quadratic", but you can see that the equation is
      -0.0002x<sup>2</sup> + 0.017x + 0.1896, and the fact that there is a squared term in the equation tells you this
      is for the quadratic trend line.</p>
    <p>Switch to the "Fill and Line" settings in the "Format Trendline" window, and change the line color to something
      that's different from the straight line, and easy to see.</p>
    <p>Now, back to the "Trendline options" where you started - you can try out polynomials of different order by
      increasing the number on your quadratic fit. Try 3, 4, and 5. You'll see that going to 3 changes the shape a
      little - it flattens out the early part of the curve and makes it peak more sharply in the late 1990's. After that
      increasing the order of the polynomial barely changes the shape of the line - this is a pretty good indication
      that these higher-order terms aren't helping to describe the pattern of change.</p>
    <p>Next we will learn how to test whether adding a term significantly improves the fit of the line to the data.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Test for an increase in fit as you add higher-order terms</strong>. We are going to build a table
      that tests whether the quadratic fits better than the linear, whether the cubic fits better than the quadratic,
      whether the fourth order fits better than the cubic, and whether the fifth order polynomial fits better than the
      fourth order.</p>
    <p>The basic idea is that we need to know how much <em>additional</em> variation we are able to account for in the
      count data by adding each higher-order term. If the amount is large enough to be statistically significant, we
      have justification for including the term. When we get to a point that adding higher-order terms no longer
      improves the fit, we can stop and interpret the simplest model that fits the data well.</p>
    <p>Remember from the regression review, we can divide the sums of squares for the bird counts into a portion that
      can be explained by a line through the data (the model SS), and a portion that is random, unexplained variation
      (the residual SS). As we go from a straight line to a quadratic model, the quadratic will fit the data better by
      some degree - we can calculate the difference in the unexplained, random variation as a measure of how much
      additional variation is explained. We can use this additional explained variation in an F test, in which we divide
      the MS for the explained variation by the residual MS. This is very much like the F-test we conduced in the ANOVA
      table we produced for our simple linear regressions, but in this case we're testing for significant increases in
      fit by making the model more complex.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell F1 type "Trend", and in F2 type "Linear", in F3 type "Quad", and in F4 type "Cubic", F5 type "Fourth",
        and in F6 type "Fifth".</li>
      <li>Lay out the columns of this table we're building:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell G1 type "Total SS". </li>
        <li>In H1 type "R2" - this will be the R<sup>2</sup> reported by Excel for each line.</li>
        <li>In I1 type "Residual df". </li>
        <li>In J1 type "Residual SS".</li>
        <li>In K1 type "Model df".</li>
        <li>In L1 type "Residual diff."</li>
        <li>In M1 type "df diff."</li>
        <li>In N1 type "F"</li>
        <li>In O1 type "p"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Now to calculate the values for the table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Total sums of squares is just the sum of the differences between the OSPR data and the mean of the OSPR data.
        Use an array formula to calculate this in cell G2 as =sum((c2:c75-average(c2:c75))^2) - remember to use
        CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array formula! If you did it right you should get 2.316... as your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Note that the total SS is determined entirely by the y-data, so it is the same for all five models. Enter =g$2
        in cell G3, and then copy/paste this to cells G4, G5, and G6.</li>
      <li>Enter the R<sup>2</sup> from each of the fitted lines. You will have one already for the straight line (which
        goes in H2), and to get the rest set the order of the polynomial to 2 and record R<sup>2</sup> in the Quad row
        (G3). Then set the order to 3 and record the R<sup>2</sup> for the Cubic row, and so on to the fifth-order
        polynomial.</li>
      <li>Let's skip to the model degrees of freedom first, we'll need them to calculate residual degrees of freedom.
        Model df is:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 for the linear regression - enter a 1 in K2. This is true for linear regression in general, one df is
          assigned to the slope estimate.</li>
        <li>2 for quadratic regression - enter a 2 in K3. We still have a slope coefficient for the linear term, as well
          as a coefficient for the quadratic term, so 2 df.</li>
        <li>3 for cubic regression - enter a 3 in K4 (one df for linear, one for quadratic, one for cubic).</li>
        <li>4 for fourth order - enter a 4 in K5 (you get the idea... keep adding one for each new term).</li>
        <li>5 for fifth order - enter a 5 in K6.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now to enter residual df. Residual df is calculated as: total df - model df. Since total df is sample size -
        1, we have a total df of 73 for each model (74 years of data - 1 = 73).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For residual df for the Linear model, in cell I2, enter the formula =73 - k2.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste this formula to the rest of the rows (cells I3 to I6). You'll have numbers starting at 72 for
          linear, declining by 1 each row to 68 for the Fifth order model.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The residual SS is the random, unexplained variation. We don't have an ANOVA table to get this from, but we
        can calculate it from the total SS and the model R<sup>2</sup>. If you recall, R<sup>2</sup> is Model SS/Total
        SS, and Total SS is Model SS + Residual SS, so R<sup>2</sup> is Model SS/(Model SS + Error SS). This means that
        R<sup>2</sup> is a proportion of a total, and 1-R<sup>2</sup> will give us the proportion of Total SS that is
        not explained, which is Residual SS.<br>
        <br>
        For example, an R<sup>2</sup> for 0.3873 for the straight line means that 38.73% of the variation in Osprey
        counts is explained by the line - the implication is that 1-0.3873 = 0.6127, or 61.27% is not explained. To find
        61.27% of the Total SS we just need to multiply Total SS by 1-R<sup>2</sup>. <br>
        <br>
        To calculate residual SS for the straight line, then, in cell J2 type =g2*(1-h2). Copy and paste this formula to
        the rest of the cells to get Residual SS for the other four models.</li>
      <li>Now to calculate how much additional variation the quadratic model explained compared to the linear model we
        can just subtract their Residual SS. Adding terms <strong>must always reduce</strong> the residual SS, so we
        need to subtract the residuals for the less-complex model from the more-complex model.<br>
        <br>
        Enter the formula: =j2-j3 in cell L3 <br>
        <br>
        (we entered this in the Quad row, because we will use it to test whether we improved model fit by adding the
        quadratic term). Copy and paste this to the rest of the cells to get the reduction in residual SS from adding
        each term to the model compared to the model just above it in the list.</li>
      <li>Calculate the difference in df between the models - in cell M3 type =i2-i3, and copy/paste to the rest of the
        rows (it should be 1 for each row).</li>
      <li>Now we have the SS for Linear and or Quadratic, and we can calcuate the F test to tell us if the Quadratic
        model improved fit.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell N3 enter the formula =(L3/M3)/(j3/i3). This calculates an MS for the extra variation explained when
          we added the quad term (L3/M3), and divides it by a residual MS (j3/i3). Copy and paste this cell the rest of
          the rows to get F ratios for each added term.</li>
        <li>In cell O3 enter the formula =fdist(n3,m3,i3) - this will give you a p-value for the F ratio in cell N3,
          given the numerator df in M3, and the denominator df in I3. Copy and paste this to the rest of the rows to get
          p-values for the rest of the added terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Your table should look like this:</p>
    <img src="ospr_models_table.png" alt="Osprey models">
    <p>Based on these calculations, we significantly increased the explained variation when we added the quad term, but
      not when we added the cubic term, the fourth-order, or fifth-order terms. Consequently, we'll base our
      interpretations on the quadratic model. </p>
    <p>Select everything in the Quad line, and hit CTRL+I, then CTRL+B to italicize and bold the characters for the
      model you will be interpreting.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Calculate the coefficients for the first derivative</strong>. Now we want to know what the change in
      Osprey count per year is, at any given year. We need to calculate the first derivative of the quadratic to do this
      - it sounds hard, but it's actually not.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First we'll get Excel to give us the model coefficients for the quadratic model. In cell F8 type
        "Coefficients", and in F9 type "m2". In G9 type "m1", and in H9 type "b". With a quadratic relationship we'll
        have an intercept (b), a linear coefficient (m1), and a quadratic coefficient (m2), so we need spaces for all
        three.</li>
      <li>Select all three cells below your labels, F10 through H10 - you can do this by clicking once in F10, holding
        the mouse button down, and dragging to H10, or by selecting F10, holding down SHIFT, and then clicking H10. Your
        selection should look like this: <img src="selected_quad_coef_range.png" alt="Range selected"> </li>
      <li>We are going to use the linest() function, short for "line estimation", to get the coefficients for that
        quadratic line in our graph. Without changing the selected cells, type the function:<br>
        <br>
        =linest(c2:c75, b2:b75^{1,2},TRUE,FALSE) <br>
        <br>
        and then CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array formula. <br>
        <br>
        This function is estimating the line, using the known y-data (c2:c75), and the known x-data (b2:b75). Raising
        the x-data to the power of 1 and 2 (in the curly braces) tells linest() to use both the first and second order
        terms, which gives us a quadratic fit. The last two are options are for whether we want to estimate the
        intercept (we do, so it's set to TRUE), and whether we want some additional regression statistics (we don't, so
        it's set to "FALSE"). As an array formula it returns the coefficients into the cells you selected, so we get all
        three coefficients at once. Note that all three of the output cells are part of the array formula - you can't
        change F10, G10, or H10 by themselves anymore, you have to select all three and edit the array formula for the
        entire set.</li>
      <li>Now that you know the coefficients, you can calculate the first derivative:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In cell F12 type "Derivative"</li>
        <li>In cell F13 type "m1"</li>
        <li>In cell G13 type "b"</li>
        <li>In cell F14 type the formula =2*f10. This is the exponent (2) on the quadratic term multiplied by the
          coefficient for the quadratic term (f10).</li>
        <li>In cell G14 use the formula =g10. This is the coefficient for the linear term, which becomes the constant
          (i.e. the intercept) for the first derivative.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>5. <strong>Calculate the rate of change each year</strong>. You may already know that the first derivative of a
      parabola is a straight line, and sure enough we now have a constant and a slope to multiply by year for our first
      derivative, which makes it a straight line.</p>
    <p>In cell D1 type "Rate of change", and in cell D2 type =g$14+f$14*b2. Copy and paste this to the rest of the
      years. If you look down the Rate of Change column you'll see that the rate of change was positive until about
      1990, when Osprey started declining.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Plot the rates of change</strong>. Select Year.number and the rates of change, and insert a scatter
      plot with only connecting lines and no plot symbols. These columns are not sitting right next to each other, but
      you can select the Year.numbers first (by clicking on B1, holding, and dragging to the bottom of the year numbers
      in cell B75), and then holding down the CTRL key and clicking, holding, and dragging on the Rate of Change values
      in column D.</p>
    <p>To get the scatter plot with lines and no plot symbols, click on the scatterplot icon in the Insert tab again,
      but this time select the option that shows only straight lines with no symbols, <img src="scatter_just_lines.png"
        alt="Just lines">.</p>
    <p>You can add a title, and title it "Rates of change in Osprey counts". The axis labels are still "Year number" for
      x, and "Change in osprey number" for y.</p>
    <p>7. <strong>Repeat</strong>. Now you can repeat this for the other four species. Specifically, for each species:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plot the counts per hour vs. year for each species.</li>
      <li>Try out polynomials as high as 5. Test whether each added term is significant.</li>
      <li>Pick the highest order model to interpret.</li>
      <li>Calculate the coefficients of the model (with linest()).</li>
      <li>Calculate the coefficients for the first derivative.</li>
      <li>Calculate the rate of change for each year.</li>
      <li>Plot the rate of change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A couple of hints...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As long as you use the same cells in each sheet, the set of tests of each term (Linear, Quad, Cubic, Fourth,
        and Fifth) is copy and paste-able for all of the species. You can copy the Osprey table from cells F1 to O6 and
        paste it into cell F1 for each species. The total SS will re-calculate for each new species, and the degrees of
        freedom are the same for all of them. All you need to do is enter the new R<sup>2</sup> values for the curve
        fits, and the rest of the table will update for the new species.</li>
      <li>The linest calculation, and the derivative calculation is the same as long as the order of the polynomial is
        the same. If the order is not the same, you'll need to adjust a bit. For example, you will need a fourth order
        polynomial for Bald Eagles. The linest() and derivative calculation steps need to be adapted to having five
        coefficients in the model, and four in the first derivative:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate coefficients up to m4 when you do linest(). Start with m4 in cell F9, and work your way down to b
          in cell J9. When you do the linest() command, select all of the cells from f10:j10, and make sure you raise
          the known x's to the power of {1,2,3,4} in the linest() function.</li>
        <li>The derivative coefficients will now go up to m3 - enter m3 into cell F15, and work your way down to b. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>In cell F14 multiply the coefficient in F10 by 4</li>
          <li>In cell G14 multiply the coefficient in G10 by 3</li>
          <li>In cell H14 multiply the coefficient in H10 by 2</li>
          <li>I16 will just be the coefficient in I10.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When you calculate the rate of change, you will multiply the coefficient in F14 by year raised to the power
          of 3, the coefficient in G14 by year raised to the power of 2....like so:<br>
          =F$14*B2^3+G$14*B2^2+H$14*B2+I$14<br>
          This can then be copied and pasted for the rest of the years.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You can copy and paste the Osprey coefficients, derivatives, and rates of change to any bird with a
        second-order polynomial fit, and the Bald Eagle coefficients, derivatives, and rates of change to any bird with
        a fourth-order polynomial fit. All of the species are one or the other (sorry to ruin the suspense!).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you're done, make sure you can interpret the rates of change graph - which years show increases, which show
      decreases, and in which were they stable?</p>
    <p>Also look at how the trends compare for breeding birds and migrating birds - year 32 is 1966, and year 76 is
      2010, so are the rates of change you're seeing for those time periods in agreement with the BBS trends? Note that
      the units are different on the BBS data - they are numbers of individual seen per route surveyed. When comparing
      between BBS and Hawk Mountain trends focus on the sign on the trend, and whether the trends were different for
      recent counts than overall for each species.</p>
    <h2>Optional for Biol 420, required for 620 - do the Osprey analysis in R</h2>
    <p>Download this <a href="hawks.Rmd">Rmd</a> file to the same folder the hawks.xlsx file is in, start R Studio, and
      make a new project from an existing folder using the folder with the data and Rmd file in it. Open the Rmd file
      and follow the instructions. For this kind of statistical analysis you'll see R is actually much quicker and
      easier to use (you have to know a little more about what you're doing to make the graphs work, but comparing the
      model fits is much easier). Do the Osprey trend analysis, and then feel free to do other species if you want the
      practice.</p>
