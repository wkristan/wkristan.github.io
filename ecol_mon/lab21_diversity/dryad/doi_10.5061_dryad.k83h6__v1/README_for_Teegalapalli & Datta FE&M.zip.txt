Data description: Vegetation data (trees and regeneration) was collected from different-aged successional sites formed following shifting cultivation and uncut forest sites. Data was collected from two replicate sites each from 2 year, 12 year, 25 year and 50 year old successional sites and two uncut forest sites. Trees (diameter at breast height, DBH>=3 cm) were inventoried and identified to species or genus level in twelve 7 m radius plots located 25 m from each other on alternating sides of a 250-m transect. We enumerated the regeneration comprising of seedlings (height<=25 cm) and saplings (height>25 cm & <=100 cm) of tree species in each of the four successional stages and the uncut forest sites in 1-m and 3-m radius nested within the 7-m radius plots, respectively. Detailed methods are provided in the methods section of the main article.

Data table 1: 2y.sites.csv

This table contains vegetation data from a 2 year old successional site.

Column headings: 

Column A: List of tree species recorded

Column B: Girth at breast height, gbh (1.3 m)

Column C: Basal area (basal.area, calculated from dbh)

Column D: List of saplings of tree species

Column E: List of seedlings of tree species

Data tables 2, 3, 4 & 5: 12y.sites.csv, 25y.sites.csv, 50y.sites.csv & uncut.sites.csv

These tables contain data from 2 replicate sites each from 12 year, 25 year, 50 year old successional and uncut forest sites.

Column A: List of tree species recorded

Columns B, C, D, E, F, G, H: Girth at breast height (gbh) of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh bole, respectively

Some trees had multi-stems/boles close to the base. We measured each individual bole and had data columns for each bole. One tree in the 50 year successional site had seven boles, so we kept up to seven columns for consistency.

Column P: Effective gbh of the tree (effective.gbh, calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of the individual bole gbh)

Column Q: Basal area (basal.area, calculated from gbh)

Column R: List of saplings of tree species

Column S: List of seedlings of tree species
