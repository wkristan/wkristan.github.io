    <h1>Analysis of field trip data - accuracy assessment</h1>
    <p>Today we will work on comparing data we collected in the field to the
      cover type maps we produced from LandSat data (unsupervised classification
      map) or downloaded (landuse_2016_simple.shp). </p>
    <p>There are a lot of steps needed to get this task done, but the task is
      conceptually simple. The basic road map for the day is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Import GPS points into ArcMap</li>
      <li>Overlay the GPS points that indicate the actual cover type we observed
        in the field with the cover type maps we have been working with</li>
      <li>Make a "confusion matrix" that compares what we observed in the field
        with what the maps say would be there.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are multiple steps involved for each of these, which are given
      below.</p>
    <h2>Import GPS points into ArcMap</h2>
    <h3>Calculating positions of points at a distance from the observer</h3>
    <p>The data from our field outing is in <a href="ground_truthing_points.xlsx">this
        file</a>. Download it into your S: drive.</p>
    <p>If you open the file in Excel, you'll see that there are several columns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Point number - a unique, sequential ID number.</li>
      <li>Obs.East - the UTM East coordinate of our observation points recorded
        in the field from our GPS.</li>
      <li>Obs.North - the UTM North coordinate of our observation points
        recorded in the field from our GPS.</li>
      <li>Distance - the distance recorded with the range finders.</li>
      <li>Direction - the direction to the point recorded with the compasses.</li>
      <li>Description - the description of the feature recorded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I did some checking, and a few points had data entry errors that placed
      them in wildly incorrect locations - those have been dropped from the data
      set. We have 45 points that were accurate enough to use.</p>
    <p>Before we can plot the points on the map, we need to calculate the
      locations from the GPS locations, distances, and directions.</p>
    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="Location from dist. and direction." src="location_dist_direction.png"><br>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>In the illustration to the left, we have a GPS location of 492570
              E, 3656770 N, and from that point we are recording the rock
              outcrop that is 56.57 m away, at 45°. We need to calculate the
              number (x) to add to our known east coordinate, and the number (y)
              to add to our known north coordinate to get the coordinate of the
              rock outcrop. You can see that the red line with our recorded
              distance forms a right triangle with lines running due north and
              due east from the point (in blue), so we can use trigonometric
              functions to figure out what we want to know.</p>
            <p>Remember from your trigonometry class that the sin of an angle
              (A) is the opposite side of a right triangle divided by the
              hypotenuse - the hypotenuse is the red line with our measured
              distance, which we'll call D, so:</p>
            <p>sin(A) = x/D</p>
            <p>Solving for x we get:</p>
            <p>x = D sin(A) = 56.57 sin(45) = 40.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the cos of A is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse,
              so:</p>
            <p>cos(A) = y/D</p>
            <p>y = D cos(A) = 56.57 cos(45) = 40</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Once we have these x and y values, we just add x to East and y to North
      to get our new coordinates - the new coordinates are thus E + D sin (A),
      and N + D cos (A). You can see from the UTM grid that the rock pile is
      indeed at 492610 E, 3656810 N, which is 40 m north and 40 m east of the
      original point. </p>
    <p>To do these calculations on the data in Excel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter "East" into G1, and "North" into H1. These will be the UTM east
        and north coordinates for the feature we are mapping.</li>
      <li>The first feature we are mapping is the rock outcrop in row 2. In cell
        G2, enter the formula =b2+d2*sin(radians(e2)) - this is the east
        coordinate of the rock outcrop. Notice that this is just translating the
        formulas for x and y above into Excel syntax, except for one thing -
        rather than just taking the sin of the direction with sin(e2), we need
        to convert the direction from degrees to radians, which are the units
        that Excel uses in all of its trig functions.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You remember radians, right? Radians express angles in terms of the
          distance around a circle with a radius of 1, which is 2π. An angle of
          90 degrees is π/2 radians, an angle of 180 is π radians, and in
          general an angle of A degrees is 2π * A / 360 radians, or (π * A / 180
          radians, to simplify)).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>In cell H2, enter the formula =c2 + d2*cos(radians(e2)). This is the
        north coordinate of the rock outcrop.</li>
      <li>Copy and paste G2 and H2 to the rest of the rows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some points were recorded by standing at the feature and recording its
      location, and didn't require any displacements to be added to them. We are
      dealing with this by using a 0 distance and direction for those points -
      that way we can enter the calculation once, copy/paste for all the other
      rows, and get the correct result regardless of whether the point is at a
      distance from the recorded GPS coordinate or not.</p>
    <h3>Converting field descriptions to cover types</h3>
    <p>When we overlay these points with cover type maps, we will only want to
      use the points that recorded a cover type, and not the ones that recorded
      the un-mappable habitat features. We will use a column in Excel that we
      can filter on later, so that we can just focus on the cover type points.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell I1 type "Type", and then for each row enter either "Cover
        type" or "Feature". For example, rock outcrops, fences, perch locations,
        and snags are all features. Shrub or scrub, bare ground, riparian, lake,
        and developed are all cover types.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will also want to use the same cover type categories as are in our
      land use vector maps, and in your unsupervised classification cover type
      maps. There are two different systems that we used, so we'll need a column
      for each:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell J1 type "Cover", and then for every "Cover type" row record
        the cover type category used in your unsupervised classification maps
        that matches the description. These are the nine cover types listed in
        the instructions for Lab 5 (cover typing).</li>
      <li>In cell K1 type "LU", and then for every "Cover type" row record the
        land use category found in the landuse_1990_simple.shp or
        landuse_2016_simple.shp files we used for change detection analysis last
        week. There are 14 categories, but only a few pertain to the area we
        sampled - you can see what the land use categories are in your
        transition matrices from last week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you do this, note that spelling counts - if you use different labels
      for the same thing it will make your work harder later. Once you enter a
      cover type of land use category once, copy it and paste it wherever else
      you need it to ensure that you enter things the same way every time.</p>
    <p>Save the Excel file onto your S: drive, and quit Excel. MAKE SURE YOU
      QUIT EXCEL or ArcMap will refuse to open the file.</p>
    <h3>Importing GPS data into ArcMap</h3>
    <p>Now, to import the GPS data from the Excel file into a point layer. Start
      up ArcMap with a blank map, and do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can add data from an Excel spreadsheet like you would a map layer
        - click on the "Add Data" button and go find the spreadsheet, then
        double-click the file name to see a list of the worksheets within it.
        You'll see that there is only one worksheet, called "FieldPts$" - select
        it and click "Add".</li>
      <li>We haven't told ArcMap which columns to use as spatial coordinates
        yet, so there's nothing plotted on the map, but you should see
        "FieldPts$" in your table of contents (note that adding a data table
        that can't be mapped switches the table of contents to "List by Source"
        mode, so the locations of all the files is given as well as the file
        names).</li>
      <li>Right-click on the "FieldPts$" entry, and select "Display XY Data". In
        the "Display XY Data" field that pops up: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Set the "X Field" to"East"</li>
        <li>Set the "Y Field" to "North"</li>
        <li>Click "Edit..." to set the coordinate system - we need to tell
          ArcMap that these are UTM coordinates. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Open "Projected Coordinate Systems" → "UTM" → "WGS 1984" →
            "Northern Hemisphere" → "WGS 1984 UTM Zone 11N". </li>
          <li>Click "OK" to set the coordinate system for the points.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Click "OK" to display the coordinates. You will get a warning that
          the table does not have an Object ID field, which is okay for now
          (we'll fix that in the next step), so click OK.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You will now have a new layer in your table of contents called
        "FieldPts$Events", which is plotted on the map as points. You can
        right-click on FieldPts$Events and zoom to it to see the points.</li>
      <li>We need to convert these to a layer in your Biol420.mdb database now
        so that we can do the overlays we want to do. Right-click on
        FieldPts$Events, and select "Data" → "Export data". Set the "Output
        feature class" to go into your Biol420.mdb file, with a name of
        "field_points", and click "OK".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you switch to "List by Drawing Order" mode in the table of contents,
      you can drag the points above the imagery layer. You can also label the
      points by their descriptions - double-click on "field_points", and switch
      to the "Labels" tab. Check the box to "Label features in this layer", and
      set the "Text string" to "Label Field:" of "Description". Set the color of
      the label test to a nice bright yellow, and click "OK". You'll new see the
      labels for each point on the map.</p>
    <p>You can right-click and remove "FieldPts$Events", and "FieldPts$", you
      don't need them now that you have a map layer of that data.</p>
    <p>Now that we have field points and their attributes, we need to overlay
      them with our cover type maps to see how well the cover type maps reflect
      what we find on the ground.</p>
    <h2>Overlay GPS points with cover type maps</h2>
    <p>Add the landuse_2016_simple.shp file from the lab7 folder, and your
      unsupervised classification map that you re-classified into our nine cover
      types (which should be called "cover_spring11" in your biol420.mdb file).
      You can also add the "World Imagery.lyr" file as background.</p>
    <h3>Extract cover types from your unsupervised classification cover type map</h3>
    <p>Now we can extract cover type categories from the cover_spring11 map,
      using the field points to identify which pixels to record - for each
      point, we will get a row in an output table that records the pixel value
      it touches.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the "Arc Toolbox", locate "Spatial Analyst Tools" → "Extraction" →
        "Sample", and launch the tool.</li>
      <li>Set your unsupervised cover type map as the "Input rasters", and
        "field_points" as the "Input location raster or point features". The
        output table can go to your S: drive, as a table called "field_unsup"
        (with no extension - this will make ArcMap use its own data table
        format, which does a better job of preserving the names of the fields in
        the attribute table).</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Sample tool makes a table, but does not make a new point layer, so
      nothing new will be on the map. You will see a table called "field_unsup"
      in your table of contents, though. If you open the field_unsup, you'll see
      there is a column called "FIELD_POINTS" that gives the point number from
      the field_points layer, and a column called "SP11_COVER" that gives the
      cover types. We need to add these columns back into the field_points file,
      which we can do by "joining" the tables. </p>
    <p>Joining database tables is done based on matching entries in each table.
      Once they are joined, the columns from both tables can be displayed and
      used as though they were a single table. To join "field_unsup" to the
      attribute table of "field_points", do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Right-click on "field_points", and select "Joins and relates" →
        "Join".</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>In the "Join Data" window, set:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"1. Choose the field in this layer that the join will be based on:"
          to "OBJECTID"</li>
        <li>"2. Choose the table to join to this layer, or load the table from
          disk:" to "field_unsup"</li>
        <li>"3. Choose the field in the table to base the join on" to
          "FIELD_POINTS"</li>
        <li>Click "OK" to join the tables.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If you right-click on field_points and open the attribute table, you'll
      see that there are now columns at the end that come from field_unsup,
      including the one that gives the cover type code from SP11_COVER.</p>
    <h3>Extract land uses from landuse_2016_simple</h3>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Joins don't permanently join columns to an attribute table, they just
      link files for use temporarily. But, the join does persist if we use the
      joined file in an operation that makes a new output file. We'll take
      advantage of that now to overlay field_points (and its joined field_unsup
      table) with landuse_2016_simple to make a new point layer with an
      attribute table that has the cover types we observed in the field (from
      field_points), the cover types in the cover_sp11 map (from the joined
      field_unsup table), and from the land use map for 2016 (from
      landuse_2016_simple). That attribute table will have everything we need to
      compare what we observed in the field to either of the maps.</p>
    <p>To do the overlay:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select "Geoprocessing" → "Intersect". An intersection is like the
        union operation we used in our change detection exercise, except that
        only the overlapping features are retained - since we only want
        information about the land use polygons that the points fall into, this
        is a better choice for our purposes.</li>
      <li>In the "Intersect" window:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "field_points" and "landuse_2016_simple" as the "Input
          features".</li>
        <li>Set the output feature class to go to your biol420.mdb database, and
          call it "field_vs_maps"</li>
        <li>Click "OK" to run the intersection.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You will get a new point layer added, field_vs_maps, in your table of
      contents. If you right-click and open the attribute table, you'll see that
      you now have the LU_current field appended to the end.</p>
    <p>While you have the attribute table open, we can simplify the next step if
      we "turn off" columns that we don't need for making our confusion
      matrices. For example, we don't need to know the feature ID numbers from
      various files we used along the way - position your pointer over the
      column label "FID_field_points_field_unsup", right-click, and select "Turn
      field off". This hides the field from view, and will also prevent it from
      being exported. You can repeat this with every column <em><strong>except</strong></em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Description</li>
      <li>Type_</li>
      <li>Cover</li>
      <li>LU</li>
      <li>field_unsup:SP11_COVER</li>
      <li>LU_current</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you make a mistake and turn off the wrong thing, you'll need to drop
      down the menu in the upper-left corner of the Table window and select
      "Turn All Fields On" and start again.</p>
    <p>We are going to convert the field_vs_maps file to an Excel spreadsheet so
      we can do our confusion matrix calculations using PivotTables. </p>
    <p>By the way, you may have noticed we worked a little differently today
      than in previous labs - so far we have only used ArcGIS table file format
      or have generated point layers within our biol420.mdb database, but have
      not used the dbf file format (either as an output table in Sample, or
      indirectly by creating a shapefile as an output layer in our intersection
      operation - remember, shapefiles use dbf as the format for attribute
      tables). We needed to avoid dbf files because our field names are long and
      descriptive, but the dbf format only allows 8 characters for field names.
      If we used a dbf file as an output table, or used a shapefile as an output
      point layer format, our field names would all have been changed to
      something that fits in 8 characters, no matter how unintelligible the new
      name is. If we go straight form an ArcGIS table to an Excel file, all the
      field names will be preserved.</p>
    <p>Now, to export the field_vs_maps attribute table directly to an Excel
      spreadsheet file, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the ArcToolbox, open "Conversion Tools" → "Excel", and then launch
        "Table to Excel".</li>
      <li>Select as the "Input Table" your "field_vs_maps" layer.</li>
      <li>Put the output Excel file on your S: drive, and call it
        "field_vs_maps" (an xls extension will be added automatically).</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the conversion tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Make a "confusion matrix" that compares what we observed in the field to
      what the map says would be there</h2>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Open field_vs_maps.xls in Excel. You'll see that the only columns in the
      spreadsheet are the ones we left turned on in the attribute table for
      field_vs_maps. </p>
    <p>We are going to make a confusion matrix for each of the maps - we'll
      start with the unsupervised classification map.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insert a PivotTable, and drag "field_unsup_SP11_COVER" into the ROWS.
        This is what the map says is at each point, and you will see your
        numeric codes </li>
      <li>Drag "field_points_Cover" into the COLUMNS. This is what we actually
        saw in the field, translated into one of our nine cover types.</li>
      <li>Drag "field_points_Cover" again into VALUES, and make sure the value
        field setting is "Count" (it should be by default).</li>
      <li>Drag "field_points_TYPE_" into FILTERS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make a new worksheet for your results - click on the plus in the circle
      to make a new worksheet. Re-name the sheet to "Confusion". Switch back to
      your pivot table in Sheet1.</p>
    <p>You can drop down the list in cell B1 and just show "Cover type" rows.
      Copy the cells in your pivot table (starting with cell A4, and including
      enough cells to get the row and column totals), and paste-special as
      values into cell A3 in your new worksheet. In cell A1 type "Confusion
      matrix - unsupervised classification". You can now replace the row labels
      with the cover type names as you assigned them (you should have saved an
      Excel file that gave the numbers you assigned, and the cover type names
      associated with them).</p>
    <p>Now we'll do the land use categories from landuse_2016_simple.shp:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Switch back to your pivot table on sheet 1, and click inside of it to
        bring up the layout window. </li>
      <li>Drag all the fields out of ROWS, COLUMNS, and VALUES. </li>
      <li>Put "LU_current" into the ROWS</li>
      <li>Put "field_points_LU" into "COLUMNS", and again into "VALUES".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should now have a confusion matrix showing the mapped land uses in
      landuse_2016_simple.shp (rows) compared with what we saw in the field
      (columns). Copy and paste-special to cell A20 of the Confusion sheet, and
      label cell A18 "Confusion matrix - land use".</p>
    <p>MAKE SURE YOUR ROW AND COLUMN LABELS ARE THE SAME ON YOUR CONFUSION
      MATRIX</p>
    <p>It's possible that there might be some cover types on your map that we
      didn't see in the field, or cover types we saw in the field that weren't
      mapped. The accuracy statistics instructions assume that you have the same
      set of cover types in your rows and columns, and if that isn't true make
      it so before you move on.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy statistics</h3>
    <p>Now to calculate the accuracy statistics for the maps. For each of your
      confusion matrices, make sure the rows and columns are sorted in the same
      order so that the matches are on the main diagonal. Then do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall accuracy - four cells below the bottom of your confusion
        matrix, type "Overall accuracy", and in the cell next to it enter a
        formula that sums the matches, and then divides by the total number of
        points.</li>
      <li>Label the column two over from the end of your confusion matrix
        "Producer's accuracy", and then in each row divide the matches by the
        row totals.</li>
      <li>Label the row two down from the bottom of your confusion matrix
        "User's accuracy", and then divide the matches by the column totals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do this for each confusion matrix. It's possible that students will have
      different numbers of rows and columns, depending on how they assigned the
      point descriptions to cover types, so I can't give you specific
      instructions for which cells to use, or what the formulas will be. Try
      coming up with the formulas yourself, and I'll help if you run into
      trouble.</p>
    <p>Look over the mis-classifications for each map - look down the columns to
      see which cover types were hard to map accurately, and to see what cover
      types were incorrectly assigned to each cover type. Look across the rows
      to see what the mapped cover types proved to be when we checked in the
      field - what mistakes did each method make? And, think about the
      mis-classifications in terms of two possible causes: 1) changes over time,
      such that the map was accurate when it was made but it now no longer
      reflects conditions on the ground, and 2) mapping errors. It may not
      always be obvious, but a point that was mapped as developed land and found
      in the field to be undeveloped is probably a mapping error - it is very
      unlikely that houses were converted to undeveloped land. The opposite
      (land that is mapped as undeveloped, but was found to be developed) is
      more likely to be an actual change on the ground - we would have to find
      out when the development was done to be certain, but it's much more
      plausible from first principles.</p>
    <p>That's it! Save your confusion matrix spreadsheet, you'll be using it in
      your project write-ups.</p>
