    <h1>Life table models</h1>
    <p>Life tables are used to track the history of a cohort of individuals that are marked at birth until every
      individual in the cohort dies. Life tables assume known fates, meaning that we know each year whether each
      individual has lived or died, which in most instances requires geographic closure and perfect detectability (that
      is, we assume the probability of encounter is 1). For any species that lives longer than a few years life tables
      are extremely difficult to construct, and are thus relatively rare. More commonly, estimates for survival and
      reproduction are made for individuals of various known ages or age classes (such as juveniles and adults) over a
      period of a few years, and these age-specific values can then be used to estimate a life table for the species.
      This is the kind of life table we will be working with today, which was constructed using survival and
      reproductive rates for ravens in the Mojave study that we used last week to estimate reproduction.</p>
    <p>The <a href="raven_life_table.xlsx">life table</a> I put together for you is for a hypothetical population of
      1000 female ravens (download it and open it in Excel). Life tables are often constructed just for females, because
      males just don't matter (well, not that they don't matter at all, but since females do the egg laying they are
      more important for the population growth rate than males are).</p>
    <p>The spreadsheet has only three columns at this point: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Age (x) - the age of the ravens in years</li>
      <li>nx - the number of ravens remaining from the original 1000 at each age</li>
      <li>mx - female offspring produced per female</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you select a cell other than B2 in the nx column you'll see it's actually a formula, multiplying the number in
      the previous cell by a survival rate to get the expected number of individuals that year. The survival rates are
      in cells B20, B21, and B22, and which one is used depends on the age of the birds. The survival rate currently
      entered in B20 is 0.35 for the first year, in B21 is 0.8 for the second year, and in B22 is 0.8 for adults. These
      are set up as formulas to make it easier for us to try out different values to see how population growth rate
      changes.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Similarly, once ravens reach breeding age the mx column shows a value of 1.027 for offspring per female, but
      you'll see that all of the non-zero entries are pointing to either B23, B24, or B25 depending on the age of the
      birds. The values in those three cells are all set to the same number of 1.027 at the moment, but we will be able
      to change the reproductive rate for young breeders (age 3 and 4), experienced breeders (ages 5 through 13), and
      old breeders (ages 14 and 15) to see how age-specific changes in reproduction would affect growth rate. The cells
      are color coded so you can easily see which of the cells in the nx and mx columns are being calculated by the
      rates in B2 through B26.</p>
    <p>Now to analyze the life table:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Calculate survivorship (lx)</strong>. Survivorship is the proportion of the original cohort still
      alive at age x. This is different than the annual survival rate, and it declines each year as an increasing number
      of the original 1000 birds dies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell D1 type "lx"</li>
      <li>In cell D2 type =b2/b$2. The age 0 lx in a life table will always be 1, since this is initial number of
        individuals born into the population, before any mortality has occurred.</li>
      <li>Now, copy and paste D2 to the rest of the ages (D3 through D18).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll see that you now have proportions of the original population that are alive at each age - since each
      number is being divided by 1000, check that your lx numbers are the nx values divided by 1000.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Calculate lxmx</strong>. In E1 type "lxmx", and in E2 type =c2*d2. Copy and paste this to the rest of
      the ages. This column weights the reproduction values from column C by the proportion of the population still
      alive at that age.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Calculate net reproduction, R0</strong>. In cell D22 type "R0", and in E22 sum the lxmx column. This
      is the net reproductive rate, and if it's over 1 the population is increasing (you should get a value of 1.0814).</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Set up the Euler equation</strong>. We will use the Euler equation to estimate growth rate, r, in the
      next step. The Euler equation is:</p>
    <p><img alt="Euler" src="euler.png"></p>
    <p>We already have l<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub> in column E, so we just need to multiply the lxmx values in E by e<sup>-rx</sup>,
      and then sum the values.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell D23 type "r", and in E23 enter a 0 - this is our initial guess for the value of r (which means the
        population is...what? Stable, increasing, or decreasing? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('pop.incr')">Click
          here to see if you're right</a>)
        <div style="display: none;" id="pop.incr">
          <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> When r is 0, the population is stable. </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>In cell F1 type "lxmxe-rx"</li>
      <li>In cell F2 type =e2*exp(-e$23*a2) - this multiplies the lxmx value in E2 by the exp the negative of our guess
        for r in cell E23 multiplied by the age in A2.</li>
      <li>Copy and paste F2 to the rest of the ages.</li>
      <li>In cell E20 type "Sum", and in F20 sum the lxmxe-rx column - this is the Euler equation calculation, and it
        should be the same value as the R0, 1.061431 while growth rate is set to 0 (why? Because anything raised to the
        power of 0 is 1, so our exp(-e$23*a2) function is returning 1 for every row - multiplying lxmx by 1 gives the
        same values as lxmx).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We already know that our initial guess for r of 0 is wrong, because R<sub>0</sub> is over 1. But, that's okay -
      the value of 0 is just the starting point we need for Solver to work with.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Estimate r from the Euler equation</strong>. Fire up Solver, and have it set the Euler sum in F20 to
      a value of 1 by changing the value of r in cell E23. You should get a value of 0.012688 - which means the
      population is...what? Stable, increasing, or decreasing? <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('r.est')">Click here
        to see if you're right</a> </p>
    <div style="display: none;" id="r.est">
      <p style="border-style: solid; padding: 10px;"> Our estimate of r is greater than 0, so the population is
        increasing. </p>
    </div>
    <p>6. <strong>Calculate generation time</strong>. Generation time tells us how how much time there is separating
      generations - that is, how old the ravens are on average when they reproduce.</p>
    <p>To get generation time we need to multiply the lxmx column by the age column - in cell G1 type "xlxmx", and in G2
      enter =a2*e2. Copy and paste to the rest of the ages.</p>
    <p>Now, in cell D24 enter "G" (for generation time), and in cell E24 enter the formula =sum(g2:g18)/e22 - this
      divides the sum of the xlxmx column by the net reproductive rate in E22. This value of 6.2289 tells you that on
      overage ravens are 6.2298 years older than their offspring.</p>
    <p>7. <strong>Calculate lambda</strong>. The discrete version of r, which is equal to next year's population size
      divided by this year's, is called Î», and is equal to the e<sup>r</sup>. In cell D25 write "Lambda", and in E25
      enter =exp(e23). The population is increasing 1.2769% each year.</p>
    <p>8. <strong>Record the results of the initial model</strong>. Now to record the estimated lambda for this first
      life table analysis.</p>
    <p>In cell A28 enter the label "Lambdas". In A30 enter the label "Initial", and then copy the lambda value from cell
      E25 and paste-special the value to cell B30.</p>
    <p>9. <strong>Make some changes to parameter values</strong>. Now we can try setting each of the parameters in B20
      through B25 to 90% of their current values, one at a time, to see how this affects population growth. The basic
      process will be to change one of the parameters, run Solver to get a new estimate of r, and then record the lambda
      value in the Results list below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decrease first year survival by 10% by entering the formula =0.9*0.35 in B20.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Run Solver to get a new estimate of r. All of the other statistics will update accordingly.</li>
        <li>Label A31 "First year s".</li>
        <li>Copy lambda from E25 and paste-special its value to B31.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put first year survival back to 0.35, and change second year survival in B21 to =0.9*0.8</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Run solver to get a new estimate of r</li>
        <li>Label A32 "Second year s"</li>
        <li>Copy and paste lambda to B32.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put second year survival back to 0.8, and change adult survival to =0.9*0.8</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Run solver to get a new estimate of r</li>
        <li>Label A33 "Adult s"</li>
        <li>Copy and paste lambda to B33.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put adult survival back to 0.8, and change Repro. Young to =0.9*1.027.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Run solver to get a new estimate of r</li>
        <li>Label A34 "Repro young"</li>
        <li>Copy and paste lambda to B34. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put repro. young back to 1.027 and change Repro. exper. to =0.9*1.027</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You get the idea...use the label "Repro. exper." for the statistics.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Finally, put repro. exper. back to 1.027, and set Repro. Old to 0.9*1.027.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do that voodoo that you do so well.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>11. <strong>Graph the results</strong>. The most important statistic for monitoring purposes is the population
      growth rate - we'll focus on lambda as our growth rate measure, as we will be using that when we do matrix models
      next time.</p>
    <ul>
      <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,sans-serif;"></span>
      <li>Select the labels and lambda values in cells A30 through B36.</li>
      <li>Insert a line chart (the first one with lines and no symbols is fine).</li>
      <li>Add a y-axis label, and call it "Growth rate (lambda)".</li>
      <li>Edit the chart title to read "Effect of 10% reduction in demographic rates on growth rate"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see that the demographic rate that has the biggest effect on growth rate is adult survival - a 10%
      reduction in adult survival drops lambda the most relative to the initial value of 1.01277. Changing adult
      survival is more important than changing survival of the younger ages, because the adults are doing most of the
      breeding.</p>
    <p>Reproduction is less important in general, particularly for the older birds. Very few ravens live to 14 or 15
      years old, so reducing their reproductive rate has almost no effect on population growth. Since the species is
      relatively long-lived, each individual usually has more than one opportunity to breed, and survival is low for the
      first year, so most of the offspring produced die before breeding. Long lived species often show a greater
      sensitivity to changes in adult survival than to change in juvenile survival, or reproduction in any age.</p>
    <p>That's it! Save your spreadsheet for your report.</p>
