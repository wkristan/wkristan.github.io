    <h3>Sensitivity and elasticity in R</h3>
    <p>Sensitivity and elasticity is much easier to calculate in R than in Excel, with just a couple of commands. The
      only reason to prefer Excel is that it's easier to see what's going on, so spotting errors is easier (but, since
      it takes more steps it's probably easier to make mistakes in the first place with Excel, so there you go). </p>
    <p>We are going to calculate the "sensitivity matrix", which we will then use to calculate the "elasticity matrix"
      in R. The sensitivity matrix can be calculated as the "outer product" of the reproductive values (the left
      eigenvector) and the stable age distribution (the right eigenvector) for our demographic matrix. </p>
    <p>1. <strong>Calculate the sensitivity matrix</strong>, using the following commands (note that anything after a #
      symbol is a "comment" that explains the command, but can be omitted):</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">W &lt;- eigen(urban)$vectors</span>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This command places the right eigenvectors into an object called W. Note the assignment is from the right side to
      the left side here because the arrow points to the left.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">w &lt;- abs(Re(W[,1]))&nbsp;</span> </p>
    <p>This command converts the first right eigenvector to real numbers, and take the absolute values. Assign to
      lowercase w (R is case sensitive, watch cases). This is the eigenvector associated with the growth rate, which can
      be used to calculate the stable age distribution. We didn't actually have any imaginary numbers in our
      eigenvectors or eigenvalues, but they are common and this formula will work even if you do have them.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">V &lt;- solve(Conj(W))&nbsp;</span> </p>
    <p>This command finds the matrix inverse (solve) for the "conjugate" of uppercase W (the conjugate is needed when
      working with complex numbers that have both real and imaginary parts - common in matrix models, but not here. We
      could omit it without affecting the results, since we don't have imaginary numbers in our W matrix). The inverse
      is assigned to uppercase V.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">v &lt;- abs(Re(V[1,]))</span>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This takes the absolute values of the real parts of the first row of the inverse matrix, and assigns the result
      to lowercase v. This is the first left eigenvector, which we could use to calculate the reproductive values. These
      aren't on a proportional scale, but that's okay for calculation of sensitivities.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">s &lt;- v%o%w</span> &nbsp; </p>
    <p>This command calculates the "outer product" of v and w. This is a matrix multiplication in which the first
      element of v is multiplied by each element of w to create the first row, the second element of v is multiplied by
      each element of w for the second row, etc. The outer product of v and w is assigned to s, which is the sensitivity
      matrix. </p>
    <p>Note that we got sensitivities by multiplying the left by the right eigenvector, but when we used Excel we also
      had to divide by the matrix product of vw, which we didn't do here. The reason is that R's approach to obtaining v
      and w scales them so that the matrix product of v and w is 1, which makes the final division step unnecessary.</p>
    <p>We got sensitivities calculated for parameters that were set to 0 in the urban matrix, which we don't need. We
      can set to 0 for any demographic rate that's zero in urban:<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">s[urban == 0] &lt;- 0&nbsp;</span> </p>
    <p>We don't estimate sensitivity to parameters that are equal to 0, so this command replace the elements in the
      sensitivity elements with 0 if the demographic rate is 0 in urban.</p>
    <p>If you type s you should see the sensitivities match what you calculated in Excel.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Look at the numbers</strong>. Type s at the command prompt to see the values. Take a look at which
      parameters have the biggest sensitivities - you'll see that every non-zero parameter in urban has a non-zero
      sensitivity.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Calculate elasticity</strong>. We can calculate the elasticities by multiplying each sensitivity by
      the demographic rate divided by the growth rate.</p>
    <p>Extract the growth rate and assign it to object lambda with:</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">eigen(urban)$values[1] -&gt; lambda</span></p>
    <p>Divide the demographic rates in urban by lambda, and assign the result to urban.lambda:</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">urban/lambda -&gt; urban.lambda</span></p>
    <p>Finally, multiply the sensitivities by urban.lambda and assign to object urban.elast with:</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">s * urban.lambda -&gt; urban.elast</span></p>
    <p>Note that this seems as though it shouldn't work, because it looks like a matrix multiplication (we are, after
      all, multiplying a matrix (s) by another matrix (urban.lambda)). But, in R there is a difference between
      multiplying one matrix by another (which is done by multiplying all the matching elements) and doing a matrix
      multiplication (which is the matrix multiplication we learned about in lecture - multiply across columns of the
      left and down columns of the right, and sum the products). In R a matrix multiplication would be s %*%
      urban.lambda, using the %*% operator for the matrix operation instead of just a *.</p>
    <p>Type urban.elast to see the values, they should match what you calculated in Excel.</p>
