    <h1>Change detection</h1>
    <p>We will be quantifying changes in cover types between 2004 and 2018 today, using vector cover type maps like the
      ones we worked with the first week of class, as well as their raster-ized version. We will be able to see how
      change detection is done using vector or raster data this way, with the same set of cover types.</p>
    <p>These cover type maps are maintained by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), and they are primarily
      used for land use planning purposes. They are thus much more detailed in the developed land cover types than they
      are in their undeveloped cover types - most vegetated areas are just called "Landscape open space", and there are
      no categories for different habitat types. But, we will be able to tell when undeveloped land in 2004 has been
      developed, and what it has been converted to, which is sufficient for tracking conversion of undeveloped land to
      developed land. To keep the analysis relatively simple I condensed the 60+ different cover types in the original
      data into a set of 11, most of which are different types of human development.</p>
    <p>We could use any two years for this exercise, but these two were chosen because we have NAIP images taken near
      the same time that the cover type maps were produced, and we will be able to make use of the NAIP images to assess
      the accuracy of the maps in our next exercise.</p>
    <h2>Comparing cover types between 2004 and 2018 - raster cover type maps </h2>
    <p>Let's start with the raster versions of the maps. Start up ArcMap and load lu_2004_rast and lu_2018_rast, which
      are the vector cover type maps converted to a raster format. I used 30 x 30 m pixels to be consistent with the
      size we have been using for our LandSat bands.</p>
    <p>If you right-click on the raster maps and open their attribute tables, you'll see that the attribute tables have
      both a numeric code and a text label in them, which makes them easy to interpret. To help you keep track of which
      map is which, the label for land use is called "LU_2004" for the 2004 data, and "LU_2018" for the 2018 data. All
      we need to do is to compare pixel to pixel between the two maps, and count up how often the land uses are the same
      between the years, and how often they are different - this is called "cross tabulating".</p>
    <p>Once we are done we will have a "transition matrix" that will look something like this (with only four of the
      cover types shown to keep the example simple - these numbers are not the ones you will get from the actual map,
      and are just for illustrative purposes):</p>

    </table>
    <p>The cover type of a pixel in 2004 is indicated in the row labels, and the cover type of the same pixel in 2018 is
      indicated in the column labels. The data are expressed as square meters. To interpret the table, pick a cover type
      from 2004 in one of the rows, and read across the columns to see what the land cover has become in 2018. You'll
      see that all of the 900,000 square meters of residential area in 2004 was still there in 2018, and none of it
      became landscape open space, water bodies, or agriculture. There was a total of 2,728,800 square meters of
      landscape open space in 2004, of which 2,700,000 were still landscape open space in 2018, but 1800 square meters
      was converted to residential, and 18,000 square meters was converted to agriculture, and 9,000 square meters
      became water bodies (presumably due to habitat restoration, or changes in reservoir level). Similarly, water body
      area was still water body in 2018 (450,000 of 456,300 m<sup>2</sup>), but some was converted to residential (1,800
      m<sup>2</sup>), some was converted to agriculture (900 m<sup>2</sup>), and some was converted to landscape open
      space (3,600 m<sup>2</sup>, probably due to ecological succession, or low water level in reservoirs). All of the
      agriculture from 2004 was still present in 2018.</p>
    <p>We will calculate a table like this, using all 11 of the cover types in the cover type maps. ArcMap will give us
      the cross-tabulation, and we can add totals in Excel.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Cross tabulate the maps</strong>. </p>
    <p>First we will need to generate the cross-tabulation of the raster maps in ArcMap.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Open the ArcToolbox, and navigate to "Spatial Analyst Tools" → "Zonal" → "Tabulate Area" - double-click to
          start the tool.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Select lu_2004_rast as the "Input raster or feature zone data", and select "LU_2004" as the "Zone field".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Specify lu_2018_rast as the "Input raster or feature class data", and "LU_2018" as the "Class field".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Put the output table in your monitoring.mdb, and call it "trans_rast".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The processing cell size will come from the lu_2004_rast layer (the first one you selected) - the tool will
          read the size of the pixel and use that to convert the counts of pixels into areas. The pixels are 30 x 30 m,
          but the units of measure used by the layer is feet, so the numbers we get in the table will be in square feet.
          How would you know this if I didn't tell you? See below...</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click "OK" to run.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the analysis is complete you'll have trans_rast listed as a table in your Table of Contents. Note that it
      also sets the Table of Contents to "List by Source" mode, which shows the location of the files in your TOC,
      complete with drive letters and paths. You can't drag files around to re-order them in this mode - if you need to
      re-arrange files, you would need to switch back to "List by Drawing Order" mode, which you select by clicking on
      the left-most icon just beneath the "Table Of Contents" window title bar. Keep the TOC in "List by Source" mode
      for now, though, so we can export the table to an Excel file.</p>
    <p>**How can you know the units used for trans_rast? The units are read from lu_2004_rast, and you can see what they
      are by right-clicking on that layer, opening its "Properties", and switching to "Source" - if you scroll down to
      the "Raster Information" section it gives the size of the cells, and the "XY Coordinate System" section lists the
      "Linear unit" as being "Foot_US" - so, each pixel is 98.4252 feet x 98.4252 feet, which is the same as 30 m x 30
      m. Why, you ask, did I use a spatial reference that uses feet when I wanted to define pixels in nice, round metric
      units? The answer is, I wasn't thinking straight. But, having made the mistake it seemed a good opportunity to
      show you how to look up the sizes of pixels in a raster map, so teachable moment and all that.**</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Export the file</strong><strong>, open it in Excel</strong>. If you right-click and open the
      trans_rast table you just created (double-clicking will not work!), you will see it has a column for "LU_2004",
      which gives the cover type in 2004. The columns to the right are labeled "AGRICULTURE", "BEACH", etc., which are
      the category names for the 2018 file - since they were converted to column names, which cannot have spaces, the
      spaces are replaced with underscores, but otherwise they will match the categories from the 2004 file, and will be
      in the same alphabetical order. </p>
    <p>We want to get these data into Excel so we can do some data summary, like so:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start up Excel from within CougarApps, with a blank worksheet. Double click on the "Sheet1" label and change
        it to "Raster".</li>
      <li>Switch back to ArcMap, and open the trans_rast table. Click on the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of
        the table, and choose "Select all".</li>
      <li>Next, position your mouse over the gray boxes to the left of the cells in the table and right-click, then
        select "Copy Selected". This is tricky - you must be in the gray boxes to the left of the cells, and you must
        right-click.</li>
      <li>Now, switch to Excel and paste into cell A1. If you don't get the complete table you didn't do the select all
        / copy selected step correctly, go back and do it again.</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,sans-serif;">You should now have the table in Excel.</span><br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>3.<strong> Calculate totals, convert to hectares, and calculate percents of rows</strong>. First we'll calculate
      totals for 2004.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell O1 (that's capital letter O with a 1 after it) type "2004 Total", and in cell O2 type =sum(c2:m2), and
        hit ENTER. You now have the total area in square feet of agriculture in 2004 in the watershed.</li>
      <li>Select the cell in O2 (by left-clicking just once - don't double-click), right-click and select "Copy". Then
        select the rest of the cells, O2:O12, right-click and paste. You now have the areas of each of the cover types
        in 2004. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next we'll calculate the 2018 totals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In row B14 type "2018 Total", and in cell C14 type =sum(c2:c12), and ENTER. You now have the total area of
        agriculture in 2018. </li>
      <li>Copy and paste this cell to the rest of the columns, D14 to M14, to get the totals for the rest of the cover
        types.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, we want to convert the numbers from square feet to hectares - the numbers are huge as square feet and
      difficult to interpret (they are also not metric units, which is not very scientific). There are 107639 square
      feet in a hectare, so if we divide the numbers in square feet by 107639 we will get area in hectares.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First we'll get the layout of the table copied to a new set of cells below - select cells A1 to M12, copy, and
        paste to A18 - this will put all the row and column labels in place, and we will write over the data values with
        our hectares.</li>
      <li>In A16 enter the label "Areas in hectares"</li>
      <li>In cell C19 (where the agriculture data are) type =c2/107639 and hit ENTER - this gives you the data from cell
        C2 in hectares.</li>
      <li>Select (by left-clicking ONCE) cell C19, copy it, select C19 to M29 and paste it. You should now have the area
        of land expressed in hectares, which is a better choice for such large areas. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we will make one last version of the table that expresses the data as percentages of the row totals - since
      the row totals are the total area of each cover type in 1990, the percentage of row total will tell us what
      percentage of each land cover type in 2004 became each of the cover types in 2018.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the cells in A18 through M29 and paste them to A33 (you don't need to select the entire destination
        range, just the upper-left cell will do).</li>
      <li>Enter "Percent of row" in cell A31</li>
      <li>In cell C34 enter the formula =c2/$o2 and hit ENTER - this is the proportion of agricultural land in 2004 that
        was still agricultural in 2018 - you should see 0.726.. as the answer.</li>
      <li>Select C34 (select, by clicking once!), copy it, and paste it to the entire range C34:M44 - since there is a
        dollar sign before the column letter for the row total, $O, the same column is used for each calculation, but
        the row updates as you move down the list of 2004 cover types. This should give you the proportion of row totals
        for every cover type.</li>
      <li>To convert these to a percentage representation, click on the % button in the "Number" format block of the
        "Home" tab. Just below the % button is an "Increase Decimal" button, which you can click once to give you a
        single decimal place for your percent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If all went well, you'll see that 72.6% of agriculture in 2004 was still agriculture in 2018, and 45.7% of beach
      was still in that cover type in 2018.<br>
    </p>
    <p>5. <strong>Check for tell-ta</strong><strong>le signs of error</strong>. There are two basic reasons for a
      transition from one cover type to another in this table: 1) a conversion from one type to another in the real
      world, or 2) an error in the 2004 and/or 2018 cover type maps. Some types of errors won't be apparent (e.g. a
      change from water body to landscape open space could be due to ecological succession, or it could be a mistake),
      but some types of transitions are so unlikely they are almost certainly an error. For example, residential or
      commercial areas in 2004 are very unlikely to become landscape open space in 2018. </p>
    <p>6. <strong>Save the data</strong>. Save your Excel spreadsheet - call it "transition".&nbsp; This is the
      transition matrix for the land use changes that you'll use in your report.</p>
    <h2>Comparing land use polygons between 2004 and 2018.</h2>
    <p>Now we will see how to use vector polygons to do change detection work. Back to ArcMap...</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Load landuse_2004_simple.shp and landuse_2018_simple.shp</strong>. These are land cover vector maps,
      like the ones we used in the first lab, except that they come from different years and I have simplified their
      cover type categories.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Do a spatial overlay (union) of the two shapefiles</strong>. The <strong>union</strong> operation
      overlays the features in both of the shapefiles, makes new polygons from the overlapping polygon outlines, and
      makes an attribute table for the resulting shapefile that has all of the columns from both of the attribute tables
      from the original files. Because of this you will end up with an attribute table that tells you what the land use
      was in 2004, and what it is in 2018. The area of each new polygon is calculated as well, so we can get a
      transition matrix by cross-tabulating the cover types, and adding the areas together.</p>
    <p>To do the overlay:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>From the ArcMap menu, select "Geoprocessing" → "Union". </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>&nbsp;Drop down the "Input features" box, and first select landuse_2004_simple, then do it again and select
          landuse_2018_simple.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>&nbsp;Set the "Output Feature Class" to output to monitoring.mdb, and call the new layer "landuse_union". </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Keep all other settings at default values, and click "OK" to run it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This might take a few minutes - as long as the "Union..." progress indicator is running at the bottom of the map
      window be patient, it's still working.</p>
    <p>Once it's done, you can zoom in to one of the areas with lots of lines, and turn the landuse_union layer on and
      off to see how it compares with the other two layers. You should see that all of the lines from both
      landuse_2004_simple and landuse_2018_simple are combined in landuse_union.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Export the attribute table</strong>. Right-click and open landuse_union's attribute table. You'll see
      that there is an FID for each of the layers you overlaid, and a column identifying the land use in 2004 and
      another for 2018 as well. If you scroll to the right you'll see there is also a Shape_Length and Shape_Area
      column, which give the perimeter and surface area for each polygon, respectively. The units are taken from the
      data set - since the units used in these layers is feet, the perimeter is in linear feet and area is in square
      feet.</p>
    <p>The units are a bad choice, because the numbers are huge and hard to compare. We should also pick something
      metric, because this is Science! To get units in hectares, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> Drop down the "Table Options" menu (upper left corner of the Table window), and select "Add field".&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the "Add Field" window, use "Area_ha" as the name, and select the "Type" as "Double". We will be
          calculating an area in hectares (ha), and we want to use double-precision floating point numbers so that small
          polygons don't get assigned an area of 0. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click "OK" to create the new field (column in the table). You will now have a blank column, with &lt;Null&gt;
          appearing in all of the rows. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Right-click on the column label, Area_ha, and select "Calculate geometry". You will be warned that you are
          going to do something that can't be undone, which is fine - say "Yes". In the "Calculate Geometry" window,
          leave the property set to Area, but change the Units to hectares. click "OK". You will again be warned that
          you can't undo the calculation, which is still fine - click "Yes".</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should now have area in hectares.</p>
    <p>Now that you have the area in hectares column we can export the table to an Excel file.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the ArcToolbox, and find "Conversion Tools" → "Excel" → "Table to Excel"</li>
      <li>Drop down the "Input Table" list and select "landuse_union" - this will cause the attribute table for
        landuse_union to be used</li>
      <li>For the "Output Excel File" put the file onto your S: drive in the same place as the "transition.xlsx" file
        you made for your raster analysis - call it "landuse_union.xls"</li>
      <li>Click "OK" to run the export</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;,sans-serif;">We can now do the data summary in Excel.</span><br>
    <p>4. <strong>Open the exported table in Excel, and make the transition matrix</strong>. Switch back to Excel, and
      open the transition.xlsx file you made earlier (if it is not already open). We are now going to get a copy of the
      data from landuse_union.xls into this file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locate and open landuse_union.xls (keep transitions.xlsx open)</li>
      <li>In the landuse_union.xls file there is one worksheet, with a tab labeled landuse_union - right-clicking on the
        landuse_union tab and selecting "Move or copy..."</li>
      <li>Select "transition.xlsx" from the "To book" list, select "Move to end", and check "Create a copy"</li>
      <li>Click "OK", and you will have a landuse_union tab in your transition.xlsx file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can close landuse_union.xls now, you have a copy of the data in transition.xlsx.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Now to make the transition matrix for the vector data we will use a PivotTable. If you haven't used PivotTables
      in Excel you're in for a treat - they make your life better.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Select a cell inside of the landuse_union data (any single cell with a data value is fine, doesn't matter
        which one).</li>
      <li>Switch to the "Insert" tab, and click on "PivotTable". </li>
      <ul>
        <li>This will pop up a "Create Pivot Table" window, asking which data range to use, and where to put the new
          table you're creating. Excel will find the data range, and "New worksheet" is fine, so click OK.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>To build the table you drag names of columns out of the list at the top of the Pivot Table Fields box into the
        row, column, or values boxes below. Specifically:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Drag "lu_2004" out of the "PivotTable Fields" list, and drop it into the "ROWS" box below - each row in the
          table will be a cover type from 2004</li>
        <li>Drag "lu_2018" into the "COLUMNS" box. Each column will be the land cover found in 2018.</li>
        <li>Finally, drag "Area_ha" into the "VALUES" box. Be default any column dragged into the VALUES box is summed,
          which is what we want here - this will give us the total area, in hectares, of all the combinations of land
          cover in 2004 and land cover in 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll see that this creates a table in which the land use in 2004 is in the rows, the land use in 2018 is in the
      columns, and the total area of land in each combination of 2004 and 2018 land uses is in the body of the table.
      This is your transition matrix - the row and column labels sort automatically, and the units are already in
      hectares.</p>
    <p>The tab is called "Sheet2", which isn't very descriptive - double-click on it and change it to "Vector", since
      this is the transition matrix for the vector maps.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The table you have is using Area_ha, so the units are already hectares and there's no need to do a conversion.
      Pivot Tables automatically give row and column totals, so there's no need to do those calculations either.</p>
    <p>There are a small number of blanks for one year or the other - small differences in where the coast was drawn are
      responsible for this, because there is a little bit of area from 2004 that doesn't have any land use polygons to
      match it in 2018, and vice versa. We can hide these by dropping down the menus next to "Column Labels" and "Row
      Labels" and un-checking (blank)</p>
    <p>To get the data expressed as a percent of row total we just need to change the display settings for the Area_ha
      field:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drop down the "Sum of area_ha" menu from the "VALUES" box, and choose "Value field settings..."</li>
      <li>You'll see in the "Value Field Settings" window that the "Summarize Values By" tab is showing - switch to the
        "Show Values As" tab</li>
      <li>In the "Show Values As" tab, drop down "Show values as" and change it from "No Calculation" to "% of Row
        total", and click "OK"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can go back and forth between hectares and percent of row totals as needed. To view both at once you can copy
      the pivot table and paste it to cells below the current one:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the pivot table - select A3:M16, and copy it</li>
      <li>Paste the cells to A22 (just the upper-left cell needs to be selected)</li>
      <li>Enter the label "Percent of row" in cell A20</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll see that the values are similar to, but not identical to, the raster map version of these data. Converting
      between raster and vector maps is not perfect, and some amount of change in area can occur (how much depends on
      the size of pixels used - the distortion is greater the bigger the pixel size).</p>
    <h2>All done</h2>
