    <h1>Analysis of stage-structured population models</h1>
    <p>Today you are going to learn to estimate growth rate from age-structured
      or stage-structured population models. Demographic monitoring is
      considered the state of the art in population monitoring, because
      demographic rates are mechanistically related to population growth, and
      monitoring demographic rates provides a great deal of information about
      the reasons for population change. Using demographic rates in a matrix
      population model greatly enhances the usefulness of demographic
      monitoring. For example, over the next two activities, you will learn to
      use matrix population models to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimate growth rate of the population</li>
      <li>Calculate the stable age distribution of the population</li>
      <li>Project the population into the future</li>
      <li>Evaluate how temporary changes in population abundance affect
        population growth</li>
      <li>Evaluate how changes in demographic rates affect population growth</li>
      <li>Calculate the reproductive values for each developmental stage</li>
      <li>Identify which demographic rates are most important for maintaining
        stable populations</li>
      <li>Estimate the amount of improvement in demographic rates needed to
        stabilize a population</li>
    </ul>
    <p> We could in principle do much of this using life tables instead, but by
      expressing our data as a matrix population model we can use powerful
      matrix algebra techniques to obtain the information we need.</p>
    <h2>Raven populations in the Mojave</h2>
    <p>We are going to work with a stage-structured population model for ravens
      in the Mojave Desert. This will be a matrix version of the life table
      model we did last time, except for a couple of new wrinkles. </p>
    <p>First, real raven populations aren't made up just of breeders and
      youngsters that aren't ready to breed yet. Non-breeding adults are also
      present in the population, and non-breeders can become breeders when they
      obtain a mate and find a suitable territory. </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="Nest site" src="raven_nest_coffee_shop.jpg"><br>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Second, ravens can choose to breed in a variety of different
              environments within the desert. </p>
            <p>Towns in the desert give ravens access to artificial nest
              substrates (like the one on the left), as well as food subsidies
              (like trash and road-killed carrion), as well as water sources.
              We'll call ravens nesting in towns the "urban" population
              (granted, the town of Mojave, CA, is stretching the definition of
              "urban").</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Ravens nesting away from towns in undeveloped desert will typically nest
      in Joshua trees, which are the only natural nest substrates in most
      places, or on cliffs if they are available. Away from towns ravens do not
      have access to human food subsidies, and have to find naturally occurring
      foods. We'll call the ravens living in undeveloped areas the "desert"
      population. </p>
    <p>Between urban and desert habitats are undeveloped areas that are near
      enough to nest in natural substrates, but be close enough to developments
      for ravens to have access to at least some human food and water resources.
      The transition between two cover types is an "ecotone", so we will call
      these the "ecotonal" population.</p>
    <h2>Constructing a stage-structured population model for ravens in the
      Mojave</h2>
    <p>To construct a matrix model, we either need to be able to age the ravens,
      or at least be able to assign them to a developmental stage. The stages
      that we use should be a) unambiguous, and b) internally homogeneous.</p>
    <p>Ambiguous means unclear, or difficult to tell apart, so unambiguous
      stages are ones that we can tell apart for sure. Ages have an unambiguous
      definition - a one year old is between its first and second birthday - but
      once a raven is an adult, it isn't possible to tell its age anymore (a
      four year old and a ten year old look alike). Since we don't know how old
      the ravens are, we can't use an age-structured model, so no Leslie matrix
      for us.</p>

            <p>It is possible, however, to tell hatch year birds from juveniles,

            in transition from the gray color of hatch year birds to the brown
            color of adults over the first two years of life as well. Between
            the plumage color and iris color it's possible to tell juveniles
            from adults</td>

    <p>The second thing we need to worry about is internal homogeneity of our
      stages. Stage-based models use a single set of demographic rates to
      characterize all of the ravens in a stage, which means that we assume the
      rates are the same for the entire time ravens are in a stage. This is not
      a big assumption for stages that last a single year, like HY and J, but
      adult non-breeder and adult breeder stages are more of a concern because
      they last for a longer time period.</p>

          </td>
          <td>
            <p>For example, with only one class of breeding adults we will have
              to use a single adult fecundity for all breeders (indicated by the
              red horizontal line). If all breeding adults have the same
              fecundity, that means there is no reproductive senescence (which
              would reduce F with age) or effect of experience (which would
              increase F with age).</p>
            <p>This assumption may or may not be true - in the example in the
              left there is an increase in fecundity over time within the adult
              breeding stage (which includes all of the ravens with fecundities
              greater than 0 in the graph).</p>

          <td>
            <p>Survival probabilities are also assumed to be constant throughout
              the period a raven spends in a stage, which means no reduction in
              survival probability with age (due to biological aging) or
              increase in survival probability with age (due to learning and
              experience). The two adult survival values we'll use today for
              urban birds is 0.8 for non-breeders (red line) and 0.96 for
              breeders.</p>
            <p>It's possible, though, that there are changes in survival over
              time within stages, as shown in the example to the left.</p>

            <p>If both survival and fecundity are changing over time for adult
              ravens, then they will be correlated within that age class. The
              blue circle indicates hatch year ravens, and the red circle
              indicates juveniles and non-breeding adults (they have the same
              survival probability, and neither breeds, so they are in the same
              place on this graph). The dots in the blue or the red ellipses
              don't show a correlation between survival and fecundity because
              there is no reproduction in those age classes.</p>
            <p>But, within the breeding adults in this example (circled in
              green), survival and fecundity are positively correlated - the
              leveling off and drop in survival at high fecundity levels reduces
              the positive trend a little, but there is still a positive
              correlation overall.</p>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Why does this matter? Remember back to the reproductive rate exercise you
      did...when you calculated the number of chicks fledged per egg, you needed
      to divide a number of chicks fledged by the number of eggs in the nest. We
      tried dividing the mean fledged by the mean egg number, but this didn't
      work because numbers of eggs and numbers of chicks were correlated. The
      same is true here - in a general sense:</p>
    <p>E(f x s) = E(f)E(s) + cov(f,s)</p>
    <p>This tells us that the expected value (i.e. mean) of fecundity multiplied
      by survival is the expected value of fecundity multiplied by the expected
      value of survival <em>plus the covariance between them</em>. Covariance
      is like a correlation that hasn't been standardized to standard deviation
      units (the covariance between f and s is the correlation coefficient
      multiplied by the standard deviations, cov(f,s) = rs<sub>f</sub>s<sub>s</sub>).
      So, you can only expect multiplying fecundity and survival together to
      give you the correct value if there is no correlation between them.</p>

          <td><img alt="Our assumption" src="no_corr.png"><br>
          </td>
          <td>It's possible that the covariance is actually zero, or at least
            close enough to zero to ignore. If this was true, the population
            would look like the graphs on the left. There may be random
            variation in fecundity and survival among individuals, but there is
            no correlation between the two.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <p>This is not a ridiculous assumption - wild populations of birds typically
      have Type II surivivorship curves, meaning that they have a fairly
      constant probability of survival throughout their lives. Similarly, wild
      birds don't generally live long enough to experience reproductive
      senescence. If we have reason not to expect strong age-related changes in
      survival and fecundity, then we have reason to expect that they won't be
      correlated within a stage.</p>

            <p>Another good approach to the problem, if it was available to us,
              would be to account for the correlation between fecundity and
              survival rather than just assuming it to be zero. We could do this
              by adding additional classes, so that&nbsp; all of the correlation
              between the demographic rates is due to differences in averages
              between the classes, but with no correlation within them. The
              graph to the left is the same one as the correlated example,
              above, but by breaking up the adult breeders into four classes,
              it's possible to make the data within each class uncorrelated.
              Differences between the age classes are accounted for in the
              population growth estimate, so the correlation in survival and
              fecundity that's evident in the means for each group isn't a
              problem. </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In other words, we could address the problem of having one big
      heterogeneous stage by breaking it up into several smaller, more
      homogeneous stages. But, we don't have that luxury with our raven
      population, because we can't age them as adults. We'll have to be
      satisfied with an assumption of no correlation between fecundity and
      survival.</p>
    <p> The stages we will recognize for this model will thus be the ones we can
      tell apart: hatch year, juvenile, and adult, with adults split between
      non-breeding and breeding. A diagram of this life history looks like the
      life history diagram below. </p>

            <p>The HY stage lasts for just one year, so hatch year ravens
              survive to become juveniles with a probability of S<sub>HY</sub>.
              The juvenile stage also lasts for a single year, so juveniles
              survive to enter the non-breeding adult population with a
              probability of S<sub>J</sub> (we will assume that juveniles do not
              become breeders immediately upon reaching adulthood - two year
              olds do breed rarely, but at a low enough level to ignore).
              Non-breeding ravens survive and either remain non-breeders (with a
              probability of S<sub>NB</sub>), or transition into the breeding
              pool (with a probability of S<sub>NBBR</sub>). Breeding ravens

              territories to become non-breeders again (with a probability of S<sub>BRNB</sub>).

      remaining a non-breeder (0.7) and surviving and becoming a breeder (0.1).
      We actually don't know how often this transition from non-breeder to
      breeder happens in ravens in the Mojave, but we'll use a hypothetical
      value of 0.1 for our models.<br>

      adult survival probabilities are the same as in an urban population, but
      breeding adults have a 10% chance of becoming non-breeders (thus, there is
      a SBRNB of 0.1, and a SBR of 0.86 for the ecotonal ravens). Because the
      habitat is not as good for breeding in ecotonal areas, we will allow
      breeding ravens to become non-breeders 10% of the time, but without suffering
      a survival cost of living in the ecotonal areas.</p>
    <p>In the Desert sheet you'll see that ravens living in the desert, away
      from human-provided resources, have lower values still for hatch year
      survival, fecundity, and survival of breeders. Desert breeding ravens have
      an overall survival probability of 0.8, and have a 10% chance of becoming
      non-breeders.</p>
    <h2>Population growth rate and stable age distribution</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We will estimate the growth rate and stable age distribution for the
      urban population first, so switch to the Urban tab.</p>
    <p>1. First, we need an initial value of λ - in cell A8 write "Lambda", and
      in B8 enter a 1.</p>
    <p>Next, we need to set up the formula for the characteristic equation of
      the matrix, det(L-λI) = 0, which we will use to find λ. As you saw in
      lecture, L is the matrix of demographic rates, and λI is a matrix of λ's
      on the main diagonal and 0's everywhere else, like this:</p>
    <img alt="Characteristic equation" src="char_eqn.png">
    <p>We can do the L-λI calculation in one step, without first making a λI
      matrix, like so:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the label "L-lambda I" in cell A10.</li>
      <li>Enter =b3-$b$8 into B10. This will give you the 0-λ in the upper left
        corner of L-λI, and it will be equal to -λ. Then, copy and paste this
        into the other diagonal elements - that is, in C11, D12, and E13. You
        should have -λ in C11, and 0.7 - λ (-0.3) in D12, and 0.96 - λ (-0.04)
        in E13. </li>
      <li>For the rest of the cells, we would be subtracting 0's in the
        off-diagonals of λI from the elements in the off-diagonals of the
        demographic matrix, so we can just point to the elements in the
        demographic matrix. In cell B11 enter =b4. Then copy and paste this cell
        to the rest of the cells in B10 through E13 that are not already holding
        a value (that is, don't paste over the main diagonal you just created,
        but paste into the rest of the cells).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we need to calculate the matrix determinant, which is much more
      complicated for a four by four matrix - happily, there is a spreadsheet
      formula for this. In cell B15 enter =mdeterm(b10:e13). Note that this is a
      matrix operation, but it works on a single matrix and returns a single
      value, so it doesn't have to be an array formula. Label this with
      "Determ." in cell A15.</p>
    <p>Your layout should look like this:</p>
    <img alt="Eigen" src="eigen_equation.png">
    <p>2. To find the growth rate you just need to start up Solver, and have it
      set the determinant (in cell B15) to 0 by changing lambda (in cell B8).
      You should get a lambda of 1.0309, which indicates a 3.1% increase per
      year in the urban population. You now have an estimate of population trend
      that isn't based on any sort of abundance measure. </p>
    <p>Be careful, though, because this could be an eigenvalue of the matrix but
      still not be the population growth rate. There are actually as many
      eigenvalues as there are age classes, so it's possible to end up with
      Solver finding one of these other eigenvalues instead. Since the growth
      rate is the largest positive eigenvalue, you can double-check that you
      have it by setting lambda to 1.5 and running Solver again (a 50% increase
      per year would be explosive population growth, which is not what we see -
      starting above any reasonable value and letting Solver work down to it
      ensures that Solver's solution is the largest eigenvalue).</p>
    <p>3. Now that we know the growth rate, we can estimate the stable age
      distribution. Stable age distribution is found using the relationship:</p>
    <p><strong>Lw</strong> = λ<strong>w</strong></p>
    <p>where w is a column vector of numbers (a column vector is a matrix with a
      single column). This equation is telling us that there exists a vector, w,
      that can be matrix multiplied by our demographic matrix, or can have each
      element multiplied by our lambda estimate, and the results will be the
      same. This vector is the stable age distribution, and we're about to find
      it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell G2 write "Stable stage". Enter starting values for the four
        age classes of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 into cells G3 through G6.</li>
      <li>In cell i2 write "Lw". We're going to do a matrix multiplication of
        the matrix of demographic rates by this stable stage distribution column
        vector. The result is a matrix with the number of rows of the left
        matrix (4), and the number of columns of the right matrix (1), and we
        need to select the entire output range when we enter the formula. So
        select cells i3 through i6 as the output range, and type =mmult(b3:e6,
        g3:g6), and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array formula. If you did
        this right, all four of the cells should now be filled in, with the
        first entry equal to 0.078.</li>
      <li>In cell J2 enter "lambda w", and in J3 use the formula =b$8*g3. Copy
        and paste this to the rest of the rows, J4 through J6.</li>
      <li>The Lw and Lambda w numbers will be the same once we find our stable
        stage distribution, but they aren't yet. We now need a cell that
        compares them. In cell i8 write "SS", and in cell i9 enter
        =sum((i3:i6-j3:j6)^2), and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array
        formula. This formula subtracts the Lambda w column from the Lw column
        and squares the differences, then sums them up. If you did this right
        the number is 0.16447. Once we have found our stable stage distribution
        this SS cell will be 0.</li>
      <li>We also want our stable stage distribution to sum to 1 so that each
        number will be a proportion of the total at each stage. In cell G8 enter
        "Sum to 1", and in G9 enter =sum(g3:g6). We'll use this as a constraint
        in Solver.</li>
      <li>Start Solver, and use the following settings:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the SS cell in i9 as the objective, and have Solver set its
          value to 0.</li>
        <li>Use the stable stage numbers in G3 through G6 as the values to
          change. </li>
        <li>Add a constraint - set the sum in G9 to equal 1.</li>
        <li>Make sure the box is checked to make unconstrained variables
          non-negative (we want positive values for our stable stage
          distribution).</li>
        <li>Run Solver, and you should get the stable stage distribution (the
          first number is 0.274).</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>4. Now that you have the setup, you can copy/paste all of the
      calculations to the other two sheets (don't paste special as values, you
      want the formulas - just a plain copy and paste will do). Make sure you
      paste them in the same locations in Ecotonal and Desert as they are in
      Urban so he cell references all point to the right places.</p>
    <p>The other two populations are set up now, but since the demographic rates
      are different you need to solve for a new lambda and stable age
      distribution for each.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Switch to Ecotonal and run Solver to set the determinant to 0 by
        changing lambda - this with a new set of demographic rates we'll have a
        new growth rate.</li>
      <li>To get the new stable age distribution, run Solver again, and set the
        SS cell to 0 by changing the Stable stage values, subject to the
        constraint that Sum to 1 (G9) equals 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then repeat these steps for Desert.</p>
    <p>The population growth rates for the ecotonal and desert populations are
      both below 1, which means that these two populations are declining. Or at
      least they would be, based on the balance of births and deaths represented
      in the demographic matrices, but the regional population as a whole is
      propped up by the increasing growth rate of the urban birds. Breeding
      territories are limited in supply, and once they are full the surplus
      ravens produced in urban areas are not all able to find breeding
      territories there. The surplus produced by the urban population has to
      disperse out into ecotonal and desert sites to find territories, and even
      though conditions are not as good there, they at least have a chance to
      breed. This is a classic source-sink system, in which a large regional
      population is being supported by surplus production within the source. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Project the raven population over time</h2>
    <p>Considering the problems that unnaturally large population sizes of
      ravens cause for desert tortoises and other sensitive species, we might
      want to explore some potential ways to reduce the productivity of the
      urban population.</p>
    <p>One way to evaluate the effects of various possible approaches to
      reducing growth rate in the urban population is to use population
      projection. As a baseline for comparison, we can project the population
      using the actual demographic rates and a starting population at stable age
      distribution. Then, we can see how population growth changes when we alter
      demographic rates, or change the numbers of ravens in each age class for
      the starting population. We really only need to do this for the urban
      birds, since urban areas are the source population for the region.</p>
    <p>1. First, let's make a copy of the Urban worksheet that we can mess
      around with. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on the Urban tab, and select "Move or copy". </li>
      <li>Select "(move to end)", and check the "Create a copy" box.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Rename the tab "Projection".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Switch to the Projection sheet, and delete everything except the matrix
      of demographic rates in A1 through E6.</p>
    <p>In cell G2 enter "Pop. vector", and enter the numbers 27, 11, 26, and 36
      - these are the stable age distribution values multiplied by 100 and
      rounded to a whole number, so our starting population is as close to
      stable age as we can get, aside from rounding error.</p>
    <p>In cell H2 enter "t+1". You can then use the fill handle to extend to the
      right, which should increase the +1 part of the label - stop when you
      reach t+20 (column AA).</p>
    <p>2. Project one year. This is a matrix multiplication of the demographic
      matrix by the population vector, so we need a 4 x 1 output range selected
      - select cells H3:H6, and without changing the selection type:</p>
    <p>=mmult($b3:$e6, g3:g6)</p>
    <p>and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make this an array formula. The population
      vector for t+1 should now be in H3 through H6.</p>
    <p>You'll see that even though we have a growth rate over 1 we still had a
      slight decline in numbers for juveniles - this is due to rounding error in
      the initial population sizes, nothing to worry about, things will settle
      down in another couple of years.</p>
    <p>3. Project to year 20. Using dollar signs to identify the matrix of
      demographic rates makes the matrix multiplication copy and paste-able.
      Copy the cells in H3 to H6, and paste to i3, then continue to paste one
      column at a time until you get to Year 20 in column AA. You have now
      projected the population twenty years.</p>
    <p>You can calculate the total population size in row 8 - label F8 "Total
      N", and then in G8 sum the population vector (G3 through G6). Copy and
      paste to the rest of the columns - these are the population sizes
      projected through year 20.</p>
    <p>Confirm that lambda is predicting growth rate - in cell F9 enter "Growth
      rate". In cell G9 enter =h8/g8, which divides the population size at t+1
      by the initial population size. Since N<sub>t+1</sub>/N<sub>t</sub> is
      what we are trying to estimate with λ, we expect the number in G9 to equal
      our λ for urban of 1.0309. Copy this cell to the rest of the projected
      years (H9 to Z9). Since rounding error prevented us from starting at
      exactly stable age distribution the first calculation will be a little
      different from 1.0309, but after a couple of years the growth rate will be
      1.0309 and will stay at that number for the rest of the years. Because of
      this, it's possible to get a growth rate estimate by projecting a
      population until it reaches stable age distribution, and then using the
      ratio of population sizes to calculate λ. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>4. Plot the numbers of individuals in each age class over time. Select
      cells G3 through AA6, and plot a scatter plot with connecting lines. Time
      will be on the x-axis and population size is on the y-axis. You should
      have a line for each age.</p>
    <p>We should label the age classes - right-click and select data, and then
      switch row/column to get the series into the horizontal axis box. Then
      click the "Edit" button under horizontal axis labels and select the names
      of the age classes in cells A3 to A6. Once they are labeled, you can
      switch row/column again and the names will be retained as the series
      names.</p>
    <p>Add axis labels, and use "Year" for the x-axis, and "Number" for the
      y-axis. Add a title and call it "Population projection".</p>
    <p>Copy this graph by right-clicking and selecting "Copy". Then, paste a
      copy as a picture - right-click in a cell of the worksheet and select the
      right-most icon of a clipboard with a picture on it. This makes a copy of
      the graph that is no longer linked to the numbers in B3 through AA6, and
      will thus not change as you work through the rest of the activity. This
      will be your baseline for comparison.</p>
    <h3>Evaluating management alternatives</h3>
    <p>We are projecting the population by multiplying a set of demographic
      rates by a population vector. To evaluate various strategies for reducing
      growth rates for urban ravens, we just need to identify which demographic
      rate or population vector number we would be affecting, and then change
      it. </p>
    <p>For example, if we went out one year and knocked all of the nests we
      could find out of the trees, what would happen to the raven population?
      Since the ravens could build nests again in the next year, and survival
      isn't being affected at all, we wouldn't expect the demographic rates to
      change. Instead, this would be like reducing the number of hatch year
      ravens to 0 in the first year.</p>
    <p>1. Change the number of hatch year ravens to 0 for the first year - that
      is, change G3 to 0. You'll see in the graph that this causes a temporary
      reduction in juveniles, since there are no hatch year ravens in the first
      year to replace the juvenile mortalities, but this effect evens out
      quickly. Also, the growth rates in row 9 change for a few years while the
      population is re-establishing stable age distribution, but they never drop
      below 1.</p>
    <p>Change the title to "No HY in year 0". Then right-click and copy the
      graph, then select cell A10 and right-click and paste-special as a picture
      (MAKE SURE you use the picture option, or this graph will change as soon
      as you make any other changes to the population).</p>
    <p>2. Now we'll see what happens when we take out the breeders - set the
      hatch year birds back to 27 (enter 27 in G3), and set the breeders to 0.
      This simulates a one-time removal of the entire breeding population.
      You'll see the graph changes a lot - since we still only allow 10% of the
      non-breeding adults to enter the breeding population per year there is a
      slow replenishment of the breeding population. With no breeders the hatch
      year birds drop to zero in the second year (t+1), and with no hatch year
      birds the juveniles drop to 0 in the third year (t+2). This depletes the
      non-breeding population for several years as well, starting in year 4
      (t+3). Growth rate even drops well below 1 for the first couple of years
      while there are too few hatch year birds produced to replace mortalities.</p>
    <p>Even so, the distribution of age classes starts to recover and all of the
      stages are increasing in number again by year 10.</p>
    <p>Change the title on the graph to "No BR in year 0", and copy and
      paste-special as a picture below your first graph.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of important points to note about this part of the
      exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Even a population with lambda over 1 can decline for a period of time
        if the population is not at stable age distribution.</li>
      <li>Even severely perturbed populations (i.e. ones in which all of the
        breeders are removed) can recover if the demographic rates are not
        reduced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is actually to be expected - we calculated lambda from the matrix of
      demographic rates, without any reference to the number of individuals in
      the population or in each age class, so growth rate is only dependent on
      the demographic matrix. If we want to make the population decline, we
      would need to change the demographic rates.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Changing the demographic rates</h3>
    <p>Survival and reproductive rates are partially properties of the species
      and partially properties of the environment they live in, so to reduce
      survival or reproduction you would need to make lasting changes to one or
      the other of those characteristics. You could reduce reproduction by
      giving the birds birth control drugs, by knocking nests out of trees every
      year, or by preventing nesting in artificial structures. You could change
      survival probabilities by reducing the amount of food subsidies they get
      from us (e.g. preventing road kill or cleaning it up rapidly, covering
      trash, getting homeowners to stop feeding their pets outside), or possibly
      by using lethal animal control methods. To have a lasting effect on the
      demographic rates, these changes would have to be applied consistently
      year after year, or they would be like a temporary reduction in the
      population vector that quickly recovers.</p>
    <p>Set the number of breeders back to 36. Now we will see if discouraging
      some of the breeders from breeding each year is enough to cause the
      population to decline.</p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="Bird spikes" src="download.jpg"><br>
          </td>
          <td>Imagine that we did various things to prevent nesting on
            artificial structures, like putting up these bird spikes on ledges.
            We probably can't keep every raven from nesting anywhere in town,
            but perhaps we could prevent 10% of the breeding population from
            nesting each year. Would that be enough to cause the population to
            decline?</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In cell E5 enter =0.1*0.96 - this will move 10% of the breeders into the
      non-breeding population each year, which simulates the effect or our bird
      spikes. Then, in cell E6 enter =0.9*0.96 - this places the remaining 90%
      of the surviving breeders back into the breeding population. You'll see
      that with a new set of rates the starting population is no longer at
      stable age distribution, so there is not a smooth change initially, but
      after about year 7 the age distribution stabilizes and the population
      begins to decline.</p>
    <p>Change the title on the graph to "10% of BR become NB", and copy/paste
      special as a picture below the other two.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind, our population project is a mathematical model of what
      would happen, and it isn't perfect. For example, if we project this
      population far enough it would eventually die out completely, which should
      make you a little skeptical. If 90% of the breeding population was still
      able to breed, why would the population go extinct? In fact, what would
      probably happen instead is that the population would decline, but when it
      got small enough that most breeding adults could find territories the rate
      of breeders moving into the non-breeder category would decline to zero
      again, and the population would stabilize at a smaller size. If we really
      wanted to cause a decline that persists over time we would need to take
      away additional breeding sites every year, so that 10% of the potential
      breeders would continue to be forced into the non-breeding population even
      as the population declined, until there were no more breeding sites left.
      Our matrix model doesn't have any way to account for these sorts of
      density-dependent changes, so a projection of the population assumes that
      all of the demographic rates stay the same as the population increases or
      decreases.</p>
    That's it! Save your worksheet for your report.<br>
    <p>By the way, there are programs (like Matlab and R) that can do the
      eigenanalysis we need with a few commands. We will use Excel today, in
      part because you already know how to use it, and in part because it's
      easier to see what the analysis is actually doing if you work through it
      in Excel. If you're interested, once you're done with the analysis in
      Excel you can see the commands needed to do the analysis in R <a href="matrix_models_in_r.html">here</a>.
