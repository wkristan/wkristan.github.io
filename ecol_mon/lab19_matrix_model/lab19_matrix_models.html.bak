    <h1>Analysis of stage-structured population models</h1>
    <p>Today you are going to learn to estimate growth rate from age-structured or stage-structured population models.
      Demographic monitoring is considered the state of the art in population monitoring, because demographic rates are
      mechanistically related to population growth, and monitoring demographic rates provides a great deal of
      information about the reasons for population change. Using demographic rates in a matrix population model greatly
      enhances the usefulness of demographic monitoring. For example, over the next two activities, you will learn to
      use matrix population models to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimate growth rate of the population</li>
      <li>Calculate the stable age distribution of the population</li>
      <li>Project the population into the future</li>
      <li>Evaluate how temporary changes in population abundance affect population growth</li>
      <li>Evaluate how changes in demographic rates affect population growth</li>
      <li>Calculate the reproductive values for each developmental stage</li>
      <li>Identify which demographic rates are most important for maintaining stable populations</li>
      <li>Estimate the amount of improvement in demographic rates needed to stabilize a population</li>
    </ul>
    <p> We could in principle do much of this using life tables instead, but by expressing our data as a matrix
      population model we can use powerful matrix algebra techniques to obtain the information we need.</p>
    <h2>Raven populations in the Mojave</h2>
    <p>We are going to work with a stage-structured population model for ravens in the Mojave Desert. This will be a
      matrix version of the life table model we did last time, except for a couple of new wrinkles. </p>
    <p>First, real raven populations aren't made up just of breeders and youngsters that aren't ready to breed yet.
      Non-breeding adults are also present in the population, and non-breeders can become breeders when they obtain a
      mate and find a suitable territory. </p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="Nest site" src="raven_nest_coffee_shop.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px"><br>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Second, ravens can choose to breed in a variety of different environments within the desert. </p>
            <p>Towns in the desert give ravens access to artificial nest substrates (like the one on the left), as well
              as food subsidies (like trash and road-killed carrion), as well as water sources. We'll call ravens
              nesting in towns the "urban" population (granted, the town of Mojave, CA, is stretching the definition of
              "urban").</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Ravens nesting away from towns in undeveloped desert will typically nest in Joshua trees, which are the only
      natural nest substrates in most places, or on cliffs if they are available. Away from towns ravens do not have
      access to human food subsidies, and have to find naturally occurring foods. We'll call the ravens living in
      undeveloped areas the "desert" population. </p>
    <p>Between urban and desert habitats are undeveloped areas that are near enough to nest in natural substrates, but
      be close enough to developments for ravens to have access to at least some human food and water resources. The
      transition between two cover types is an "ecotone", so we will call these the "ecotonal" population.</p>
    <h2>Constructing a stage-structured population model for ravens in the Mojave</h2>
    <p>To construct a matrix model, we either need to be able to age the ravens, or at least be able to assign them to a
      developmental stage. The stages that we use should be a) unambiguous, and b) internally homogeneous.</p>
    <p>Ambiguous means unclear, or difficult to tell apart, so unambiguous stages are ones that we can tell apart for
      sure. Ages have an unambiguous definition - a one year old is between its first and second birthday - but once a
      raven is an adult, it isn't possible to tell its age anymore (a four year old and a ten year old look alike).
      Since we don't know how old the ravens are, we can't use an age-structured model, so no Leslie matrix for us.</p>

              transition from the gray color of hatch year birds to the brown color of adults over the first two years
              of life as well. Between the plumage color and iris color it's possible to tell juveniles from adults</p>

                come from adults, the only entry will be to enter F<sub>A</sub> in the BR column. For the "urban" ravens
                we'll be working with, this value is 0.78 female offspring per breeding female.</li>
              <li>The second row shows the contribution of each age class to J birds. Juveniles come only from HY birds
                that survive, so the only entry is s<sub>HY</sub> in the HY column.</li>
              <li>The third row shows the contribution of each age class to NB birds. These non-breeding adults come

                and BR adults that lose their territories and become NB (s<sub>BRNB</sub>).</li>
              <li>The last row are the breeding adults - they come from non-breeding adults who gain a territory and

                adults (s<sub>BR</sub> in the BR column).</li>
              <li>All other entries are zero - for example, since NB adults don't breed there is no contribution of NB
                to HY, so a 0 is entered in the NB column for the HY row. Although we have an entry for s<sub>BRNB</sub>
                it too is set to 0 - that's because this is the matrix for urban ravens, which is the best breeding
                habitat for the species in the desert, and breeding birds were not observed to lose their territories
                and become non-breeders. This did happen in poor habitat, so we will have non-zero entries for s<sub>BRNB</sub>
                in some of our Lefkovitch matrices, and the term is included here for completeness.</li>

    <p>Note that some of these entries appear low because they are dividing a survival probabilities between two
      different paths. For example, once ravens are in the non-breeding adult population their survival probability is
      0.8, but this probability is split between the ravens that survive and remain non-breeders (0.7) and those that
      survive and becoming breeders (0.1).<br>

    <h2>Population growth rate and stable age distribution of West Mojave ravens</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you download <a href="raven_matrix_models.xlsx">this</a> file, you'll see that the first worksheet, Urban,
      has this matrix in it.</p>
    <p>Switch to the Ecotonal sheet and you'll see that ecotonal ravens have a lower hatch year survival and lower
      fecundity than urban birds. Ecotonal adult survival probabilities are the same as in an urban population, but
      breeding adults have a 10% chance of becoming non-breeders (thus, there is a SBRNB of 0.1, and a SBR of 0.86 for
      the ecotonal ravens). Because the habitat is not as good for breeding in ecotonal areas, we will allow breeding
      ravens to become non-breeders 10% of the time, but without suffering a survival cost of living in the ecotonal
      areas.</p>
    <p>In the Desert sheet you'll see that ravens living in the desert, away from human-provided resources, have lower
      values still for hatch year survival, fecundity, and survival of breeders. Desert breeding ravens have an overall
      survival probability of 0.8, and have a 10% chance of becoming non-breeders.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We will estimate the growth rate and stable age distribution for the urban population first, so switch to the
      Urban tab.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Set up the model for Solver</strong>. First, we need an initial value of λ - in cell A8 write
      "Lambda", and in B8 enter a 1.</p>
    <p>Next, we need to set up the formula for the characteristic equation of the matrix, <strong>det(L-λI) = 0</strong>,
      which we will use to find λ. As you saw in lecture, L is the matrix of demographic rates, and λI is a matrix of
      λ's on the main diagonal and 0's everywhere else, like this:</p>
    <img alt="Characteristic equation" src="char_eqn.png">
    <p>To keep our worksheet a little simpler, we can do the L-λI calculation in one step, without first making a λI
      matrix, like so:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the label "L-lambda I" in cell A10.</li>
      <li>Enter =b3-$b$8 into B10. This will give you the 0-λ in the upper left corner of L-λI, and it will be equal to
        -λ. Then, copy and paste this into the other diagonal elements - that is, in C11, D12, and E13. This should give
        you -1 in C11 (which is 0-λ), -0.3 in D12 (0.4 - λ), and -0.04 in E13 (which is 0.96 - λ). </li>
      <li>For the rest of the cells, we would be subtracting 0's in the off-diagonals of λI from the elements in the
        off-diagonals of the demographic matrix, so we can just point to the elements in the demographic matrix. In cell
        B11 enter =b4. Then copy and paste this cell to the rest of the cells in B10 through E13 that are not already
        holding a value (that is, don't paste over the main diagonal you just created, but paste into the rest of the
        cells).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we need to calculate the matrix determinant. We learned how to do these by hand in the lecture with a 2x2
      matrix, but determinants are much more complicated for a 4x4 matrix - happily, there is a spreadsheet formula that
      will calculate it for us. In cell B15 enter =mdeterm(b10:e13). Note that this is a matrix operation, but it works
      on a single matrix and returns a single value, so it doesn't have to be an array formula. Label this with
      "Determ." in cell A15.</p>
    <p>Your layout should look like this:</p>
    <img alt="Eigen" src="eigen_equation.png">
    <p>2. <strong>Use Solver to find lambda</strong>. To find the growth rate you just need to start up Solver, and
      have it set the determinant (in cell B15) to 0 by changing lambda (in cell B8). You should get a lambda of 1.0309,
      which indicates a 3.1% increase per year in the urban population. You now have an estimate of population trend
      that isn't based on any sort of abundance measure.</p>
    <p>Be careful, though, because this could be an eigenvalue of the matrix but still not be the population growth
      rate. There are actually as many eigenvalues as there are age classes, so it's possible to end up with Solver
      finding one of these other eigenvalues instead. Since the growth rate is the largest positive eigenvalue, you can
      double-check that you have it by setting lambda to 1.5 and running Solver again (a 50% increase per year would be
      explosive population growth, which is not what we see - starting above any reasonable value and letting Solver
      work down to it ensures that Solver's solution is the largest eigenvalue).</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Calculate the stable age distribution</strong>. Now that we know the growth rate, we can estimate the
      stable stage distribution. Each eigenvalue (such as λ) has an <strong>eigenvector</strong> that satisfies this
      relationship:</p>
    <p><strong>Lw</strong> = λ<strong>w</strong></p>
    <p>where w is the eigenvector (a column vector, meaning that it is a matrix with a single column). This equation is
      telling us that the eigenvector, w, can be matrix multiplied by our demographic matrix, L, or can have each
      element multiplied by our lambda estimate, and the results will be the same.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell G2 write "Stable stage". Enter starting values for the four stages of 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 into cells G3
        through G6 - we will have Solver change these, so the values don't matter too much, we just need a starting
        point that isn't too far from the final values.</li>
      <li>In cell i2 write "Lw". We're going to do a matrix multiplication of the demographic rates by the stable stage
        distribution column vector. The result of a matrix multiplication is a matrix with the number of rows of the
        left matrix (4), and the number of columns of the right matrix (1), and we need to select the entire output
        range first, then type the mmult() formula, then do CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array formula, like so:<br>
        <video alt="Matrix multiply" controls="controls"><source src="mmult.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </li>
      <li>Next we will multiply lambda by each cell in the stable stage column. In cell J2 enter "lambda w", and in J3
        use the formula =b$8*g3. Copy and paste this to the rest of the rows, J4 through J6.</li>
      <li>The Lw and Lambda w numbers will be the same once we find our stable stage distribution, but they are
        different now because the values in G3-G6 aren't the right numbers yet. We now need a cell that compares them.
        In cell i8 write "SS", and in cell i9 enter =sum((i3:i6-j3:j6)^2), and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make it an array
        formula. This formula subtracts the Lambda w column from the Lw column and squares the differences, then sums
        them up. If you did this right the number is 0.16447. Once we have found our stable stage distribution this SS
        cell will be 0.</li>
      <li>We also want our stable stage distribution to be on a proportional scale, which means that the elements will
        sum to 1. In cell G8 enter "Sum to 1", and in G9 enter =sum(g3:g6). We'll use this as a constraint in Solver.</li>
      <li>Now to get the eigenvector with our stable age distribution. Start Solver, and use the following settings (see
        the video for a walk-through):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the SS cell in i9 as the objective, and have Solver set its value to 0.</li>
        <li>Use the stable stage numbers in G3 through G6 as the values to change. </li>
        <li>Add a constraint - make Solver set the sum in G9 to equal 1.</li>
        <li>Make sure the box is checked to make unconstrained variables non-negative (we want only positive values for
          our stable stage distribution).</li>
        <li>Run Solver, and the solution you get is the stable stage distribution.<br>

      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You now have the population growth rate, and know the distribution of ages that is needed for change in
      population size to be smooth over time.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Use the Urban setup to model ecotonal and desert areas</strong>. Now that you have the setup, you can
      copy/paste all of the calculations to the other two sheets (don't paste special as values, you want the formulas -
      just a plain copy and paste will do). Make sure you paste them in the same locations in Ecotonal and Desert as
      they are in Urban so he cell references all point to the right places.</p>
    <p>The other two populations are set up now, but since the demographic rates are different you need to run Solve to
      get the correct lambda and stable age distribution for each.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Switch to Ecotonal and run Solver to set the determinant to 0 by changing lambda - this with a new set of
        demographic rates we'll have a new growth rate.</li>
      <li>To get the new stable age distribution, run Solver again, and set the SS cell to 0 by changing the Stable
        stage values, subject to the constraint that Sum to 1 (G9) equals 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then repeat these steps for Desert.</p>
    <p>The population growth rates for the ecotonal and desert populations are both below 1, which means that these two
      populations are declining. Or at least they would be, based on the balance of births and deaths represented in the
      demographic matrices, but the regional population as a whole is propped up by the increasing growth rate of the
      urban birds. Breeding territories are limited in supply, and once they are full the surplus ravens produced in
      urban areas are not all able to find breeding territories there. The surplus produced by the urban population has
      to disperse out into ecotonal and desert sites to find territories, and even though conditions are not as good
      there, they at least have a chance to breed. This is a classic source-sink system, in which a large regional
      population is being supported by surplus production within the source. </p>

    <h2>Optional for Biol 420, required for Biol 620 - using population models to evaluate management alternatives</h2>
    <p>The rest of the activity is about using these models to evaluate options for managing raven population size in
      the desert.</p>
    <h4>Project the raven population over time</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Considering the problems that unnaturally large population sizes of ravens cause for desert tortoises and other
      sensitive species, we might want to explore some potential ways to reduce the productivity of the urban
      population.</p>
    <p>One way to evaluate the effects of various possible approaches to reducing growth rate in the urban population is
      to use population projection. As a baseline for comparison, we can project the population using the actual
      demographic rates and a starting population at stable age distribution. Then, we can see how population growth
      changes when we alter demographic rates, or change the numbers of ravens in each age class for the starting
      population. We really only need to do this for the urban birds, since urban areas are the source population for
      the region.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Duplicate the Urban worksheet</strong>. First, let's make a copy of the Urban worksheet that we can
      mess around with. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on the Urban tab, and select "Move or copy". </li>
      <li>Select "(move to end)", and check the "Create a copy" box.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Rename the tab "Projection".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Switch to the Projection sheet, and delete everything except the matrix of demographic rates in A1 through E6.</p>
    <p>In cell G2 enter "Pop. vector", and enter the numbers 27, 11, 26, and 36 - these are the stable age distribution
      values multiplied by 100 and rounded to a whole number, so our starting population is as close to stable age as we
      can get, aside from rounding error.</p>
    <p>In cell H2 enter "t+1". You can then use the fill handle to extend to the right, which should increase the +1
      part of the label - stop when you reach t+20 (column AA).</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Project one year</strong>. This is a matrix multiplication of the demographic matrix by the
      population vector, so we need a 4 x 1 output range selected - select cells H3:H6, and without changing the
      selection type:</p>
    <p>=mmult($b3:$e6, g3:g6)</p>
    <p>and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make this an array formula. The population vector for t+1 should now be in H3 through
      H6.</p>
    <p>You'll see that even though we have a growth rate over 1 we still had a slight decline in numbers for juveniles -
      this is due to rounding error in the initial population sizes, nothing to worry about, things will settle down in
      another couple of years.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Project to year 20</strong>. Using dollar signs to identify the matrix of demographic rates makes the
      matrix multiplication copy and paste-able. Copy the cells in H3 to H6, and paste to i3, then continue to paste one
      column at a time until you get to Year 20 in column AA. You have now projected the population twenty years.</p>
    <p>You can calculate the total population size in row 8 - label F8 "Total N", and then in G8 sum the population
      vector (G3 through G6). Copy and paste to the rest of the columns - these are the population sizes projected
      through year 20.</p>
    <p>Confirm that lambda is predicting growth rate - in cell F9 enter "Growth rate". In cell G9 enter =h8/g8, which
      divides the population size at t+1 by the initial population size. Since N<sub>t+1</sub>/N<sub>t</sub> is what we
      are trying to estimate with λ, we expect the number in G9 to equal our λ for urban of 1.0309. Copy this cell to
      the rest of the projected years (H9 to Z9). Since rounding error prevented us from starting at exactly stable age
      distribution the first calculation will be a little different from 1.0309, but after a couple of years the growth
      rate will be 1.0309 and will stay at that number for the rest of the years. Because of this, it's possible to get
      a growth rate estimate by projecting a population until it reaches stable age distribution, and then using the
      ratio of population sizes to calculate λ. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>4. <strong>Plot the numbers of individuals in each age class over time</strong>. Select cells G3 through AA6,
      and plot a scatter plot with connecting lines. Time will be on the x-axis and population size is on the y-axis.
      You should have a line for each age.</p>
    <p>We should label the age classes - right-click and select data, and then switch row/column to get the series into
      the horizontal axis box. Then click the "Edit" button under horizontal axis labels and select the names of the age
      classes in cells A3 to A6. Once they are labeled, you can switch row/column again and the names will be retained
      as the series names.</p>
    <p>Add axis labels, and use "Year" for the x-axis, and "Number" for the y-axis. Add a title and call it "Population
      projection".</p>
    <p>Copy this graph by right-clicking and selecting "Copy". Then, paste a copy as a picture - right-click in a cell
      of the worksheet and select the right-most icon of a clipboard with a picture on it. This makes a copy of the
      graph that is no longer linked to the numbers in B3 through AA6, and will thus not change as you work through the
      rest of the activity. This will be your baseline for comparison.</p>
    <h3>Evaluating management alternatives - changing numbers of ravens in each stage</h3>
    <p>We are projecting the population by multiplying a set of demographic rates by a population vector. To evaluate
      various strategies for reducing growth rates for urban ravens, we just need to identify which demographic rate or
      population vector number we would be affecting, and then change it. </p>
    <p>For example, if we went out one year and knocked all of the nests we could find out of the trees, what would
      happen to the raven population? Since the ravens could build nests again in the next year, and survival isn't
      being affected at all, we wouldn't expect the demographic rates to change. Instead, this would be like reducing
      the number of hatch year ravens to 0 in the first year.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Project the effect of removing a year of hatch year ravens</strong>. Change the number of hatch year
      ravens to 0 for the first year - that is, change G3 to 0. You'll see in the graph that this causes a temporary
      reduction in juveniles, since there are no hatch year ravens in the first year to replace the juvenile
      mortalities, but this effect evens out quickly. Also, the growth rates in row 9 change for a few years while the
      population is re-establishing stable age distribution, but they never drop below 1.</p>
    <p>Change the title to "No HY in year 0". Then right-click and copy the graph, then select cell A10 and right-click
      and paste-special as a picture (MAKE SURE you use the picture option, or this graph will change as soon as you
      make any other changes to the population).</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Remove the breeding population for one year</strong>. Now we'll see what happens when we take out the
      breeders - set the hatch year birds back to 27 (enter 27 in G3), and set the breeders to 0. This simulates a
      one-time removal of the entire breeding population. You'll see the graph changes a lot - since we still only allow
      10% of the non-breeding adults to enter the breeding population per year there is a slow replenishment of the
      breeding population. With no breeders the hatch year birds drop to zero in the second year (t+1), and with no
      hatch year birds the juveniles drop to 0 in the third year (t+2). This depletes the non-breeding population for
      several years as well, starting in year 4 (t+3). Growth rate even drops well below 1 for the first couple of years
      while there are too few hatch year birds produced to replace mortalities.</p>
    <p>Even so, the distribution of age classes starts to recover and all of the stages are increasing in number again
      by year 10.</p>
    <p>Change the title on the graph to "No BR in year 0", and copy and paste-special as a picture below your first
      graph.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of important points to note about this part of the exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Even a population with lambda over 1 can decline for a period of time if the population is not at stable age
        distribution.</li>
      <li>Even severely perturbed populations (i.e. ones in which all of the breeders are removed) can recover if the
        demographic rates are not reduced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is actually to be expected - we calculated lambda from the matrix of demographic rates, without any
      reference to the number of individuals in the population or in each age class, so growth rate is only dependent on
      the demographic matrix. If we want to make the population decline, we would need to change the demographic rates.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Changing the demographic rates</h3>
    <p>Survival and reproductive rates are partially properties of the species and partially properties of the
      environment they live in, so to reduce survival or reproduction you would need to make lasting changes to one or
      the other of those characteristics. You could reduce reproduction by giving the birds birth control drugs, by
      knocking nests out of trees every year, or by preventing nesting in artificial structures. You could change
      survival probabilities by reducing the amount of food subsidies they get from us (e.g. preventing road kill or
      cleaning it up rapidly, covering trash, getting homeowners to stop feeding their pets outside), or possibly by
      using lethal animal control methods. To have a lasting effect on the demographic rates, these changes would have
      to be applied consistently year after year, or they would be like a temporary reduction in the population vector
      that quickly recovers.</p>
    <p>Set the number of breeders back to 36. Now we will see if discouraging some of the breeders from breeding each
      year is enough to cause the population to decline.</p>
    <table width="100%" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img alt="Bird spikes" src="download.jpg" style="margin-right: 20px"><br>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Imagine that we did various things to prevent nesting on artificial structures, like putting up these
              bird spikes on ledges. We probably can't keep every raven from nesting anywhere in town, but perhaps we
              could prevent 10% of the breeding population from nesting each year. Would that be enough to cause the
              population to decline?</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In cell E5 enter =0.1*0.96 - this will move 10% of the breeders into the non-breeding population each year, which
      simulates the effect or our bird spikes. Then, in cell E6 enter =0.9*0.96 - this places the remaining 90% of the
      surviving breeders back into the breeding population. You'll see that with a new set of rates the starting
      population is no longer at stable age distribution, so there is not a smooth change initially, but after about
      year 7 the age distribution stabilizes and the population begins to decline.</p>
    <p>Change the title on the graph to "10% of BR become NB", and copy/paste special as a picture below the other two.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind, our population project is a mathematical model of what would happen, and it isn't perfect. For
      example, if we project this population far enough it would eventually die out completely, which should make you a
      little skeptical. If 90% of the breeding population was still able to breed, why would the population go extinct?
      In fact, what would probably happen instead is that the population would decline, but when it got small enough
      that most breeding adults could find territories the rate of breeders moving into the non-breeder category would
      decline to zero again, and the population would stabilize at a smaller size. If we really wanted to cause a
      decline that persists over time we would need to take away additional breeding sites every year, so that 10% of
      the potential breeders would continue to be forced into the non-breeding population even as the population
      declined, until there were no more breeding sites left. Our matrix model doesn't have any way to account for these
      sorts of density-dependent changes, so a projection of the population assumes that all of the demographic rates
      stay the same as the population increases or decreases.</p>
    <p> That's it! Save your worksheet for your report.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>By the way, there are programs (like Matlab and R) that can do the eigenanalysis we need with a few commands. We
      will use Excel today, in part because you already know how to use it, and in part because it's easier to see what
      the analysis is actually doing if you work through it in Excel. If you're interested, once you're done with the
      analysis in Excel you can see the commands needed to do the analysis in R <a href="matrix_models_in_r.html">here</a>.
