    <h1>Analysis of stage-structured population models</h1>
    <p>Today you are going to learn to estimate growth rate from age-structured
      or stage-structured population models. We will use matrix algebra
      techniques to isolate the demographic rates (which determine the growth
      rate of the population) from the abundances of organisms in each age or
      stage, and then analyze the behavior of the population based on these
      components individually, and based on their interactions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Demographic monitoring is considered the state of the art in population
      monitoring, because it is highly informative. From a population model it's
      possible to not only calculate a growth rate from a set of demographic
      rates, it's possible to evaluate how important each demographic rate is to
      the growth rate of the population. It's possible to see how much a
      demographic rate would need to be increased to turn a declining population
      into a stable one. It's possible to calculate what the stable age
      distribution for the population would be, and to compare this to the age
      distribution in the population at the moment. And, it's possible to
      project how a population would be expected to change under different
      scenarios (for example, how would the population respond if an oil spill
      caused a complete reproductive failure for one year?).</p>
    <h2>Estimating population growth rate and stable age structure with
      eigenanalysis</h2>
    <p>We are going to work with a stage-structured population model for ravens
      in the Mojave. This will be a matrix version of the life table model we
      did last time, except for a couple of new wrinkles. First, real raven
      populations aren't made up just of breeders and youngsters that aren't
      ready to breed yet. Non-breeding adults are also present in the
      population, and non-breeders can become breeders when they obtain a mate
      and find a suitable territory. Second, ravens nest in a variety of
      locations, from roofs of buildings in the middle of a town to Joshua trees
      out in the middle of the desert. Ravens in town have access to stable
      nesting substrates, water, and abundant food. They have higher survival
      rates and higher reproductive rates than ravens that nest out in the
      desert, who lack easy access to food, trash, and road-killed carrion for
      food.</p>
    <p>Ravens can't be aged, but it is possible to tell hatch year birds from
      juveniles, and juveniles from adults. Hatch year ravens have pink mouth
      linings</p>
    <p>Juveniles have brown feathers in the wings and tail, instead of glossy
      black like adults have. The mouth linings of juveniles is also pink, often
      through the second year of life. The iris of the eye is also completely
      brown in adults, but is gray in fledglings, and transitions from gray to
      brown over the first two years of life.</p>
    <p>The stages we will recognize for this model are thus hatch year,
      juvenile, non-breeding adult, and breeding adult. A diagram of this life
      history looks like this:</p>
    <p><img style="width: 381px; height: 146px;" alt="Raven diagram" src="raven_diagram.png">
    </p>
    <p>Hatch year ravens survive to become adults with a probability of S<sub>HY</sub>.
      Juveniles survive to enter the non-breeding adult population with a
      probability of S<sub>J</sub>. Non-breeding ravens survive and either
      remain non-breeders (with a probability of SNB), or transition into the
      breeding pool (with a probability of S<sub>NBBR</sub>). Breeding ravens
      survive and either remain in the breeding population (with a probability
      of S<sub>BR</sub>), or survive but lose their territories to become
      non-breeders again (with a probability of S<sub>BRNB</sub>). Finally,
      breeding ravens produce hatch-year ravens, with a fecundity per breeding
      female of F<sub>A</sub>.</p>
    <p>We will start with parameters for the "urban" ravens (those that are
      living in a human-developed area). The matrix of fecundities and survival
      probabilities for this population are:</p>

    <p>If you download <a href="raven_matrix_models.xlsx">this</a> file, you'll
      see that this matrix is in the first worksheet, Urban. We will estimate
      the growth rate and stable age distribution for the urban population
      first.</p>
    <h3>Population growth rate and stable age distribution</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Project the raven population over time</h2>
    <p>The next thing we will do is to project the population into the future
      with Excel.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Set up a worksheet for projecting the population</strong>.
      Switch to a new, blank worksheet in Excel. </p>
    <p>Switch to R and type:</p>
    <p>lambda</p>
    <p>and the growth rate will be written to the screen. Copy and paste this
      growth rate into cell F1 in Excel, and label it "Lambda" in E1.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Switch back to R, and type:</p>
    <p>data.frame(stable = stable)</p>
    <p>Copy/paste this stable age distribution to cells H2:H5, then type "Stable
      age" into cell H1. You may need to do a "text to columns" to get rid of
      the row numbers, then put the proportions into H2:H5.</p>
    <p>In cell I1 type "Starting pop", and in cell I2 type =round(100*h2,0).
      Copy and paste this to H3:H5. This will be the starting population, which
      is at stable age distribution aside from a little rounding error.</p>
    <p>You can open the csv file with the demographic matrix with Excel, and
      copy/paste the matrix of demographic rates into your worksheet, in cells
      B4:E7.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Project one year</strong>. Type the names of the age classes
      into cells A12 through A15. In cell B11 type "Year 1". Select cells B12
      through B15, then type:</p>
    <p>=mmult(b4:e7, i2:i5)</p>
    <p>and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to make this an array formula. The result of
      matrix-multiplying the demographic rates by the initial population size
      should be in cells B12-B15.</p>
    <p>You'll see that even though we have a growth rate over 1 we still had a
      slight decline in numbers for yearlings - this is due to rounding error in
      the initial population sizes, nothing to worry about.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Project to year 10</strong>. You can extend your Year 1 label
      to the right to get Year 2 through Year 10.</p>
    <p>Next, select cells C12 through C15, and type:</p>
    <p>=mmult($b$5:$e$8, b12:b15)</p>
    <p>and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This time you multiplied the demographic rates by
      the population at time 1 to get time 2.</p>
    <p>Using dollar signs to identify the matrix of demographic rates makes this
      copy and paste-able. Copy the cells in C12:C15, and paste to D12 to D15,
      then continue to past until you get to Year 10 in column K. You have not
      projected the population ten years.</p>
    <p>You can calculate the total population size in row 17 - label A17 "Total
      N", and then sum the populations in cells 12 through 15 in each of the
      columns for years 1 through 10 (that is, in cell B17 type =sum(b12:b15),
      then copy/paste this to the rest of the columns).</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Plot population growth</strong>. Select cells A11 through
      K15, and plot a line graph with year on the x-axis and population size on
      the y-axis. You should have a line for each age. Copy the graph and paste
      it to a Word file, and label it "Growth from stable age".</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Confirm that Nt+1/Nt estimates growth rate</strong>. In cell
      I19 type "Lambda", and in cell J10 type =k17/j17. This should divide the
      projected population size in year 10 by the population size in year 9, and
      it should be very close to the lambda we calculated in R, in cell F1.</p>
    <h3>Perturb the starting population</h3>
    <p>The starting population size does not dictate the intrinsic growth rate,
      but if the population is not at stable age distribution then the
      population may do some unexpected things. For example, the growth rate
      indicates that we should see a 2% increase in population size each year,
      but if we have some sort of accident that removes all of the animals in
      one of the age classes, will this still occur? We can assess this easily
      by just setting the initial numbers in each age class to 0 one at a time,
      and seeing how the population growth changes.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Change the starting population for yearlings to 0</strong>.
      Make this change to the starting population in cell I2, not the first year
      population size calculated in B12. </p>
    <p>This simulates a complete reproductive failure for one year (perhaps due
      to an outbreak of disease). Since the spreadsheet is made up of formulas,
      you will see the graph update immediately. Copy the graph and paste it to
      a Word file, and label it "Growth from yearlings = 0". Make sure to look
      at the numbers as well as the graph, the changes in the yearling age class
      are subtle compared to the other classes, and don't show up well on the
      graphs. Pay attention to which age class is most affected - the yearlings
      only spend one year as yearlings and then grow into juveniles, so there's
      no effect on the number of yearlings in the first year. The lower than
      normal number of yearlings affects the number of juveniles most, and at
      later years this propagates into the mature adults and finally into the
      non-breeders. It isn't until there is an effect on the mature adults that
      number of yearlings is affected at all, and it's a pretty minor change.</p>
    <p>Put the number of yearlings back to 4.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Change the number of juveniles to 0</strong>. Make this
      change in cell I3. You'll see that this change is much more serious, and
      affects all of the age classes. Since the primary source of juveniles is
      juveniles that survived from the previous year, a loss of all the
      juveniles one year causes the juvenile age class to drop to low levels,
      and it doesn't recover to initial numbers over ten years. Because the
      juveniles age into breeding adults, losing the juvies causes a deficit of
      breeding adults as well, since 7.36% of juveniles age into breeding adults
      each year. Thus, even though the population growth rate unaffected (it's
      still 1.025), the number of breeding adults actually declines for awhile
      until the number of juveniles increases enough to offset loss of adults to
      mortality. When you reduce the number of breeding adults you reduce the
      number of yearlings slightly as well, so you'll see a small decrease in
      the number of yearlings that parallels the reduction in breeders. The
      effect on post-reproductives is the smallest, in that they never decline
      but the rate of increase is slowed slightly. Copy and paste the graph to
      your Word file, and label it "Growth from juveniles = 0". </p>
    <p>Set the number of juvies back to 32.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Change the number of mature breeders to 0</strong>. Make this
      change in cell I4. Losing all the breeding adults impacts all of the other
      age classes noticeably. The yearlings decline because juveniles only
      rarely breed, and to need time to mature to adults to replace those that
      were lost. The juveniles decline because the supply of yearlings is
      reduced, and there are fewer new juveniles in the population each year to
      balance loss to mortality and aging into breeding adults. The
      post-reproductives decline because there are many fewer adults available
      to age into that class, and losses outweigh additions to that class for
      awhile. Copy and paste the graph to your Word file, and label it "Growth
      from breeders = 0". Set the breeders back to 32.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Change the number of postreproductives to 0</strong>. Make
      this change in cell I5. You'll see that this affects the number of
      postreproductives, but has no effect on any other class because they don't
      age to other classes, and they don't breed. Copy and paste the graph to
      your Word file, and label it "Growth from postreproductives = 0".</p>
    <h2>Evaluating management alternatives</h2>
    <p>We're going to do one more model so that we learn how to use the Solver
      in Excel to evaluate management alternatives to improve the growth rates
      of a species. The killer whale data was interesting in that it included
      non-reproductive females, but the growth rate for that population was
      already over 1, and the population evidently didn't require any
      intervention to persist. We'll focus on a model for the Spotted Owl now
      because the population has a growth rate less than 1, which will allow us
      to consider what we might do to stabilize the population.</p>
    <p>Each of the demographic rates results from different processes operating
      on different stages of the life history. Breeding adults have territories
      they defend from other Spotted Owls, which gives them a familiar space in
      which to find food and other resources they need to survive and reproduce.
      Survival for adults is probably in part determined by food, but is also
      determined by predation risk from other, larger raptors. Adult
      reproduction is likely to be limited by food resources and by predation,
      but nest predators can be very different animals than predators of adults
      (tree squirrels are major nest predators, but they're not known to hunt
      and kill adult Spotted Owls). In contrast, yearlings have no territory,
      and are young and inexperienced, which makes them more susceptible to
      predation and starvation. Juveniles don't have territories, but have
      gained experience which helps them survive. Both yearlings and juveniles
      spend time moving around the landscape looking for food, and juveniles
      begin to look for territories of their own - breaking up the forest with
      logging ("habitat fragmentation") can make this search more difficult and
      more hazardous.</p>
    <p>Now, we have already explored how different parameters affect growth rate
      to different extents, but we need to consider the management implications
      of this finding. Given that different parameters have different effects,
      what should we do next? It's tempting to say that we should put our effort
      into improving the demographic rate that gives us the biggest "bang for
      our buck", which would mean trying to improve the rate with the biggest
      elasticity. The elasticities for the owl matrix are: fecundity = 0.02,
      yearling survival = 0.02, juvenile survival = 0.02, adult survival = 0.94.
      This suggests strongly that adult survival is the rate we want to improve.
      But, as we discussed in lecture, Spotted Owl adult survival is primarily
      determined by the amount of old growth habitat in the territory. Old
      growth Douglas fir forests are those that are over 200 years old, so if we
      wanted to make more old growth to improve adult survival we would have to
      wait awhile to see any positive effect. Fecundity has a very low
      elasticity compared to adult survival, but it's primarily related to the
      availability of woodrats to foraging adult owls, which can be manipulated
      much more easily by creating some early-successional habitat for the
      woodrats in areas where foraging adult owls can get them. Thus, there may
      be some real-world constraints on what we're capable of doing that will
      dictate what we are able to do.</p>
    <p>So, what you will do next is to see how much improvement is needed in
      each of the Spotted Owl demographic rates so we can evaluate how feasible
      it is to stabilize the population with the management options available to
      us.</p>

    <p>det(L - λI) = 0</p>
    <p>We did this algebraically when we only had two age classes, but it gets a
      little more complex with three or more age classes, so we'll use a simpler
      numerical approach using the Solver. To do this, first we'll calculate the
      L - λI using an initial guess for the value of λ, then we'll take the
      determinant (which will be a single number) using Excel's mdeterm()
      function. We'll then have Solver vary λ until the determinant is equal to
      0, and the lambda that makes the determinant equal zero is our growth
      rate.</p>
    <p>In cell F1 type "Lambda", and in G1 type 1 as the initial guess for λ.</p>
    <p>If you recall, λI is just a matrix with λ along the main diagonal, and
      0's everywhere else. In cell B7 type the formula =$g$1, which will place
      the value of λ into g1. Now, copy that and paste it to C8 and D9 so that λ
      is repeated along the diagonal.</p>
    <p>Next, copy one of the zeros out of the demographic rates matrix, and
      select cells B7 though D9. Do a "Paste special", and select "Add" as the
      operation. This will place zeros in all the blank cells to complete the λI
      matrix. </p>
    <p>Next, in cell B11 type =b3-b7. This will subtract the first element of
      the λI matrix from the first element of the demographic rates matrix. Copy
      and paste this to the rest of cells B11:D13. This is now the L-λI matrix.</p>
    <p>In cell B15 type "Determinant of (L-lambda I)". In cell B16 type
      =mdeterm(b11:d13), and hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. You now have the determinant
      of L-λI, and we just need to find a value of λ that makes this equal 0 to
      get our growth rate.</p>
    <p>Start up the Solver, and set B16 to the value of 0 by changing the growth
      rate in G1. You can leave the "Make unconstrained variables non-negative"
      box checked so that λ will be forced to take a positive value, and click
      "Solve". Bear in mind that there are three eigenvalues for this matrix,
      and there may be more than one positive one - we're interested in the
      largest one, so when you're finding growth rates this way it's a good idea
      to start with a growth rate that's likely to be higher than the actual
      growth rate so that Solver can find the eigenvalue that's the largest.</p>
    <p>When Solver finishes, you'll see that the Northern Spotted Owl has a
      growth rate of 0.962, which means it's declining by about 3.8% per year
      (this is one of the primary reasons it's a threatened species). Let's see
      if we can fix this for them.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Find how much improvement in each demographic rate would be
        needed to stabilize the population</strong>. A stable population has a λ
      of 1, so for this step we will use Solver again, but this time we will
      manually set lambda to 1 and then have Solver change one of the
      demographic rates until the determinant is 0 again. The new value of the
      demographic rate will then be what is needed to stabilize the population,
      if all the other rates remain the same.</p>
    <p>For convenience, make a copy of the actual demographic rates and paste
      them to cells A20:D24 (label cell A19 "Actual rates").</p>
    <p>Set λ to 1 type typing 1 into G1.</p>
    <p>Let's start with fecundity. Start Solver, and have it set the determinant
      in cell B16 to zero by changing the adult fecundity in cell D3. </p>
    <p>In cell F19 write "Needed rates", and in cell F21 write "Fecundity". In
      cell G21 copy and paste the fecundity in D3 that is needed to make growth
      rate 1. Now, copy the actual fecundity from cell D22 and paste it to cell
      D3 so that you can try another rate.</p>
    <p>Now, find the yearling survival rate needed to stabilize growth. Set the
      determinant to 0 by changing cell B4. Label cell F22 "Yearling survival",
      and copy/paste the survival rate to cell G22. Copy/paste the actual
      yearling survival from cell B23 to B4.</p>
    <p>Now, find the juvenile survival needed to stabilize growth. Set the
      determinant to 0 by changing cell C5. Record the result (call this
      "Juvenile survival"), and then re-set the value back to the actual
      survival rate.</p>
    <p>Finally, find the adult survival needed to stabilize the population. Call
      this "Adult survival".</p>
    That's it! Save your worksheet for your report.<br>
