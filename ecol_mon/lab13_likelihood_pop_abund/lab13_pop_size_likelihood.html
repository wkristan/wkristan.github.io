    <h1>Likelihood-based estimate of population size with two capture events</h1>
    <p>The Lincoln-Petersen method has a long history, but it isn't considered a modern method of estimating population
      size. Even though it's possible to express the estimator in terms of encounter probability (n<sub>1</sub>/p), it
      isn't easy to ground LP within a rigorous statistical framework.</p>
    <p>In contrast, modern likelihood-based methods allow us to not only estimate population size, and obtain profile
      likelihood confidence intervals for the estimate, they allow us to evaluate hypotheses about the characteristics
      of our sampling procedure (i.e. trap happiness or trap shyness), and about the ecology of the organisms we are
      working with (i.e. changes in encounter probability over time). The basic approach you will learn today can be
      modified to allow multiple trapping periods, to allow open populations, to estimate survival probability, and to
      accommodate differences in capture probabilities from time to time, or after first capture. Once you understand
      the basic approach, a whole suite of methods start to make sense.</p>
    <p>But today we will focus on the method, and keep the analysis simple - we will analyze the same coast horned
      lizard "data" we used to learn the Lincoln-Peterson method, but this time using maximum likelihood methods for
      estimating population size.</p>
    <p>Sometimes likelihood functions are simple enough that it's possible to solve for the parameters we are estimating
      - estimates found by analyzing the likelihood function are called "analytical solutions". But sometimes the
      structure of the likelihood function doesn't allow us to analytically solve for parameters of interest, and we
      have to use approximate (or "numeric") solutions instead. A numeric solution is found by trying out different
      possible values for parameters we're estimating until we get as close as we need to be to the solution - for
      example, we would only ever need to know the population size to the nearest whole animal, so when we get a
      solution that is accurate to the nearest 0.1 animal we are close enough.</p>
    <p>The basic approach is illustrated in the app below. Frequencies for capture histories 01, 10, and 11 are based on
      observed data - these animals were actually captured at least once, and were marked and counted when they were
      captured. The two unknowns are the frequency of the animals never caught, which we will call f(00), and the
      probability of encountering a lizard in a single sample, which we call p. The bar chart shows the observed
      frequencies, and the expected values for each history. The expected values are the probabilities of the histories
      multiplied by the total animals, both observed and estimated - 147 animals were captured, so setting the initial
      value of f(00) of 100 means that the estimate of the total is 147 + 100 = 247 to begin. The one "observed" bar
      that is not really observed is the f(00) bar, which is being used as though it's observed for the purposes of
      calculating the expected values, but it's actually an unknown that we're estimating - I've made its bar a lighter
      blue to distinguish it from the actual observed data.</p>
    <p>The likelihood function is shown as the surface plot to the right - it is 3 dimensional because we have two
      unknowns (p and f(00), each of which are an axis on the base of the graph, which are the x and y axes) and the
      multinomial likelihood of the model the particular combination of the unknowns (which is the height of the curve,
      on the z-axis). The likelihood of the currently selected values for p and f(00) shown as a red dot - not a very
      high likelihood, so these are not good estimates given the data.</p>
    <p>As you change the values of p and f(00) the graphs change - changing f(00) changes the height of the "observed"
      bar for 00, and since the total is changing the expected bars change as well. Changing p changes the probabilities
      of the capture histories, and the relative heights of the expected counts change. The goal is to maximize the
      likelihood, which will happen when the observed and expected bars get as close as you can given the way we're
      calculating the probabilities of capture - for example, 01 and 10 have the same probability, but have different
      observed frequencies, so it isn't possible to make the observed and expected values equal each other exactly if we
      assume the probability of encounter is always the same - we'll relax that assumption next time, but for now we'll
      stick with the assumption that p is a single value that we need to estimate, but it's the same for both trapping
      periods.</p>
    <p>Try to pick values for p and f(00) that maximize the likelihood - get the bars as close to each other as
      possible, and the red dot will climb to the top of the likelihood surface.</p>

    <p>This sort of trial and error method is a form of <strong>numerical solution</strong>, but not a very
      sophisticated one. Excel supports much better numerical methods with an extension package called the <strong>Solver</strong>.
      To use the solver we need to have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A single cell that we are trying to either maximize, minimize, or set to a specified value - this is called
        the <strong>objective</strong> cell. Our objective cell will be the one that calculates the log-likelihood, and
        we will tell Solver to maximize its value.</li>
      <li>The objective has to be a function of at least one other cell whose value can be changed by the Solver. Our
        log-likelihood will be a function of the two parameters we're trying to estimate, the number of lizards we never
        caught (f00) and encounter probability (p). Solver will vary these parameters while it watches the
        log-likelihood, and it will stop when the log-likelihood is as big as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is essentially what you did with the app above - you tried out different values of p and f(00) and got the
      likelihood as high as possible, but we will use Solver to get the answer quickly and to a much higher level of
      precision.</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Set up a worksheet for ML estimation</strong>. Switch to the worksheet called "ML Estimates". You'll
      see that I've already done a little work for you - you have all four of the possible capture histories entered in
      Column A (labeled "History"), and frequencies of the three histories that can be observed in column B (labeled
      "Freq").</p>
    <p>We are going to estimate two parameters from these data. The first is the encounter probability, which we will
      call "p". The next is the frequency of the "00" capture history, which we will call f(00); remember, this is the
      number of animals that were never captured. Since there are only four possible capture histories, 10, 11, 01, and
      00, and every animal in the population must have one of them, once we have an estimate for the frequency of f(00)
      we can estimate population size as the sum of the frequencies of all these histories. Now we need to set up the
      cells that will hold these estimates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In cell D1 type "Parameter". In cell D2 type "p", and in cell D3 type "f(00)".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In cell E1 type "MLE". This is where the estimates of f(00) and p will go.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In column F1 type "Betas". These will be the values we actually have Solver vary, as these will be the
          parameters for our link functions. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what's a link function, you say? Glad you asked.</p>
    <p>Solver works by changing your input cells, and observing how the change affects the objective cell. We could have
      Solver change the parameters directly, but it doesn't know what our parameters represent, and thus doesn't know
      what values are possible and what values are impossible. For example, p is a probability, which means it has to
      fall between 0 and 1, but Solver doesn't know that. To keep Solver from selecting impossible values, we can use a
      link function that prevents p from falling outside of the 0,1 range, no matter what value Solver selects. To
      accomplish this we will use the sin link function.</p>
    <p>The sin link function takes any positive or negative value we enter in the Betas column and takes the sin of it,
      adds 1, and then divides by 2. For any input value the sin function returns values that are between -1 and 1.
      Adding 1 to the sin function puts the result between 0 and 2, and dividing 2 puts the result between 0 and 1 no
      matter what we use as an input value.</p>
    <p>So, in cell F2 type a starting "beta" value of 0.5. Now, in cell E2 type =(sin(f2)+1)/2. Now we will get a value
      in E2 that is a probability no matter what beta value Solver tries out in cell F2. This will give you a starting
      LME for p of 0.739713.</p>
    <p>Solver also doesn't know that f(00) is a frequency (i.e. a count), and that frequencies can't be negative. The
      exp() function is a good choice of link function for non-negative parameters - this is called the "log link",
      because exp() raises the base of the natural logs (e) to the power of whatever is entered as an argument. Negative
      exponents, like e<sup>-Î²</sup>, are equivalent to 1/e<sup>Î²</sup>, so as the beta value becomes an increasingly
      large negative number the function becomes an increasingly small decimal number that approaches 0 -&nbsp; since
      1/e<sup>Î²</sup> cannot be negative no matter what positive or negative value of Î² is used the log link function
      prevents Solver from considering negative f(00) values.</p>
    <p> In cell F3 type a 2 as an initial value for the beta, and in cell E3 type =exp(f3). You should have a starting
      MLE value for f(00) of 7.389056.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Calculate the probabilities of each history</strong>. Type "Multinomial probability of history" in
      cell H1. The probability of not being encountered in a single capture period is 1-p. Since an individual can only
      either be captured or not captured, p and (1-p) are probabilities of all of the two possible outcomes, and they
      will sum to 1. </p>
    <p>However, a capture history is the outcome of two different capture periods.&nbsp; The probability of a history is
      the probability of the first event occurring and the probability of the second event occurring - as you may
      remember from your stats classes, "and" tells us to multiply probabilities together. The probabilities of the
      histories are therefore:</p>

    <p> You just need to translate these into Excel formulas - in cells H2 through H5 enter formulas that calculate
      these probabilities. Make sure you point to the estimate of p in E2, and not to the betas in F2. If all goes well,
      your probabilities should be 0.192538 for histories 01 and 10, 0.547175 for history 11, and 0.067749 for history
      00.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Calculate the log of the multinomial coefficient</strong>. If you recall from lecture, the likelihood
      function has two parts: the multinomial coefficient (the counting part, which gives the number of different ways
      to obtain our set of frequencies), and the probability part (which is the probability of any one of the many
      possible ways to obtain our set of frequencies). We will start with the multinomial coefficient.</p>
    <p>The multinomial coefficient is the number of different ways to have gotten the set of frequencies that we
      observed. It is a very large number, calculated from even larger numbers. The formula for the multinomial
      coefficient is N!/(x<sub>11</sub>!x<sub>10</sub>!x<sub>01</sub>!x<sub>00</sub>!), and to use it directly we would
      need to calculate the factorial of the total population size, which is a problem. Excel is not capable of
      calculating factorials for numbers over 170 (try it - in an empty cell type =fact(170), and in another empty cell
      type =fact(171)). We would have trouble using a method that restricted us to estimating populations that are 170
      or smaller, so we need a different calculation method.</p>
    <p>Fortunately for us, we don't actually need to calculate a likelihood, we only need a log-likelihood. It turns out
      we can calculate the log of a factorial in Excel using the gammaln() function.</p>
    <p>The f(00) estimate shows up in two ways in the multinomial coefficient. The numerator of the coefficient is N!,
      but the total number of individuals includes the known total individuals trapped so far (which we will call M<sub>t+1</sub>,
      which is the sum of the frequencies of the observed histories 01, 10, 11) as well as the unknown f(00). We can
      thus express N! as (M<sub>t</sub><sub>+1</sub> + f(00))!. The denominator of the coefficient has f(00) in it
      directly, which is x<sub>00</sub>!. On a log scale this product of factorials become a sum of logs of factorials,
      which makes it possible for us to drop the logs of the factorials for the three known frequencies - we need to
      calculate ln( (Mt+1 + f(00))! ) - ln(f(00)!) for our likelihood function.</p>
    <p>As you learned in lecture, we can calculate the log of a factorial using the Excel formula gammaln(). This
      converts the calculation to gammaln(M<sub>t</sub><sub>+1</sub> + f(00) + 1) - gammaln(f(00) + 1) - note that this
      gets rid of the factorials, but we do need to add 1 to each argument. To do this calculation, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate M<sub>t</sub><sub>+1</sub> - in cell A7 type "Mt+1", and in cell A8 type =sum(b2:b4) - it should be
        147.</li>
      <li>In cell B7 type "Mult coeff.", and in B8 type: =gammaln(a8+e3+1)-gammaln(e3+1)<br>
        You can see that E3 is in this formula - the estimate of f(00) - but E2 is not, so this part of the likelihood
        doesn't depend on the encounter probability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The multinomial coefficient in B8 should be 617.77...</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Calculate the log likelihood</strong>. We have the log of the multinomial coefficient, but now we
      need to calculate the log of the probability part. The probability part is based on the probability of the capture
      histories, in column H. The log of the probability part is just the frequency of each capture history (from column
      B) multiplied by the log of the probability of the capture history (in column H), summed across the histories. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell C7 type "Prob. part".</li>
      <li>In cell C8 type:<br>
        =b2*ln(h2)+b3*ln(h3)+b4*ln(h4)+e3*ln(h5).<br>
        The probability part is the product of the probabilities of the multinomial probabilities, each with an exponent
        equal to their frequency in the data set. On a log scale, they become frequencies multiplied by the logs of
        probabilities, summed together. The final term is the probability for the history that isn't observed, so it is
        based on the estimated frequency in E3, multiplied by the log of the probability of history 00 in cell H5.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your probability part in cell C8 should be -238.045.</p>
    <p>To get the log-likelihood we just need to add the probability part to the multinomial coefficient part.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell D7 type "LnLikelihood"</li>
      <li>In cell D8 type =b8+c8</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If all went well, your layout should look like this:</p>

    <p>Congratulations! You're all ready to use maximum likelihood to estimate p and f(00).</p>

    <p>5. <strong>Interpret the results</strong>. You now have MLE's for p and f(00) - you'll see from the video that p
      should be 0.273, and f(00) should be 163.9. </p>
    <p>The value for p tells you the probability that an animal would be trapped in a single capture period - you can
      interpret probabilities as proportions of a total, and proportions multiplied by 100 are percentages, so a p of
      0.27 tells you that an estimated 27% of the animals in this population were trapped in each capture period.</p>
    <p>The population size estimate is actually the sum of M<sub>t+1</sub> and f(00), which we haven't calculated yet.
      You can write "N-hat" in cell D5, and in E5 add these numbers. You'll see the estimate is not identical to the LP
      estimate you calculated last time, but it's fairly close.</p>
    <p>You can look at the multinomial probabilities to see the probabilities of each capture history. Based on these
      estimates, the probability of not being caught in either trapping period (that is, the probability of history 00)
      was 0.528, so an estimated 52.8% of the population was never captured, and 47.2% was captured at least once during
      the study.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Assess model fit</strong>. The other thing you can look at is the "goodness of fit" of the model to
      the data. Conceptually, our model for these data is that there is a single probability of capture in both capture
      periods, and now that we have an estimate for what that probability is our probabilities of capture histories in
      column H give the distribution of individuals in the population into the four possible capture histories. One of
      the consequences of this simple model is that the probability of 01 and 10 histories is the same - they are (1-p)p
      and p(1-p), but since order doesn't matter in multiplication these products are the same. But, if you look at the
      observed frequencies, we got many more 01 histories than 10, so this simple model may not be very accurate.</p>
    <p>The probabilities of the histories in column H are the relative frequencies we expect for the capture histories,
      but these are hard to compare with the counts, so we can convert them to predicted frequencies by just multiplying
      the estimated population size in cell E5 by the probabilities of the capture histories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell I1 type "Expected", and in I2 type =e$5*h2</li>
      <li>Copy/paste this cell to the rest of the histories. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The fact that the 01 and 10 histories have the same probability but different frequencies is an indication that
      our model is too simple. We'll learn next time how to change the model to allow for different encounter
      probabilities at each capture period, and to allow for trap response (i.e. an increase or decrease in encounter
      probability after first capture). For now, just note that we have reason to want to try a different model so that
      our expected values for 01 and 10 can be different.</p>

    <p>7. <strong>Calculate 95% CI's</strong>. We're going to profile the likelihood function to get 95% confidence
      intervals for N-hat (holding p constant) and for p (holding N-hat constant). The graphs below illustrate the
      process.</p>

          <td>
            <p>We use the same likelihood function for p as we did for N-hat, but this time we keep N-hat at its ML
              value of 310.9 and use a range of possible <strong>p</strong> values - it looks like this:</p>

            <p>Note that we estimated f(00) with Solver, but what we really want to know is the population size,
              estimated by N-hat. N-hat is just the sum of the frequencies for 01, 10, and 11 (which come from the data,
              and are known) plus f(00) (which we estimated). Since it is N-hat that we want to estimate, we call
              calculate the confidence interval for N-hat, not for f(00).</p>
            <p>The ML estimate of N-hat is 310.9, so the likelihood maximizes at that value.</p>
            <p>Click the graph once and the negative log-likelihood is shown - this is just the log-likelihood, but

            <p>Click the graph again and the negative log-likelihood is positioned to touch the x-axis at y = 0 - this
              is done by subtracting the minimum value of the curve from the curve.</p>
            <p>Click again and the horizontal line at 1.92 is added in red - where the negative log likelihood function
              touches this line will be the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval.</p>
            <p>Click one last time and the interval is shown in green - these are the values of N-hat that make the
              negative log likelihood equal 1.92, and are the upper and lower limits to the confidence interval. When
              you profile the likelihood yourself you'll see that the limits you get match these.</p>

    <p>Last time you did this procedure manually for the probability that a wasp would select a mated butterfly by
      finding the likelihoods that were (roughly) 1.92 units away from the maximum. This time you will let Solver find
      the places where the red line crosses the log likelihood function, to a much higher degree of precision than we
      did last time. First some setup: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cell A13 write "Est.". Copy the current estimate of N-hat from cell E5, and in cell B13 paste-special as a
        value.</li>
      <li>In cell A14 write "Lower", and in cell A15 write "Upper".</li>
      <li>In cell B12 write "N-hat". In cell C12 write "p". We'll be filling in our lower and upper bounds in this block
        of cells.</li>
      <li>Copy the LnLikelihood from cell D8 and paste-special its value in cell D10. In cell C10 write "ML" - this is
        the actual maximum of the likelihood function.</li>
      <li>In cell G10 type =-(d8-d10). This is the negative of the difference between the current value of the
        likelihood function given the parameter estimates (d8) and the maximum of the likelihood function (in d10). If
        you recall from lecture, this difference will equal 1.92 when the value of f(00) is either at its upper or lower
        limit for the 95% CI. In cell F10 type "Diff." Note that by doing this we don't need to get the negative of the
        log-likelihood function - if we had used the negative log-likelihoods we would have just used d8-d10, without
        taking the negative of this difference. With the all of the cells still at their ML estimates this will be equal
        to 0, or a value very close to 0 (E-13 or smaller).</li>
      <li>Finally, as a convenience, we should record the values of the betas at their current ML values - it will make
        it easier to re-set later when we want to do this process again for p. Copy the betas in cells F1 through F3,
        and paste-special as values in cell A18. Change the label in A18 to "Betas ML".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, to find the upper and lower limits for N-hat, we need to find the two values of f(00) that make the
      difference in cell G10 equal to 1.92 - in other words, we will tell Solver to vary the beta for f(00) until G10 is
      equal to 1.92.</p>

          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>To get this started, displace the MLE for f(00) slightly above its current value - set the beta to
                5.1.</li>
              <li>Next, start Solver, and tell it to set cell G10 (the objective cell) to a value of 1.92 (as a specific
                value, rather than a maximum or minimum) by changing ONLY cell F3 (do NOT change F2, because we want to
                hold p constant). </li>
              <li>Have Solver find the estimate - you'll see that f(00) changed, but not p</li>
            </ul>

    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Record the value for N-hat in cell E5 as the upper limit for the 95% interval - copy and paste-special as values
      cell E5 into cell B15.</p>
    <p>Copy the betas from A19 to A20 and paste them into F2 and F3 to set things back to the ML values.</p>
    <p>Now repeat the process to get the lower limit for N-hat. Since we displaced the beta for f(00) slightly above its
      MLE you should end up with an estimate that's higher than before, so this is your upper limit. Copy the new N-hat
      from cell E5 and paste-special the value to cell B15.Now, to get the lower limit you need to displace f(00) to be
      slightly below the MLE estimate - set the beta to 5, and run Solver again. Since we started below the MLE Solver
      should find the lower limit this time. Copy and paste-special the value for N-hat from E5 as the Lower limit (cell
      B14).</p>
    <p>Copy the betas from A19 to A20 and paste them into F2 and F3 to set things back to the ML values.</p>
    <p>Copy the current value of p from E2, and paste as a value into cell C13.</p>
    <p>You can now use Solver again to find the upper and lower limits for p - this time, have Solver set the difference
      in G10 to 1.92 by changing the beta in cell <strong>F2</strong>, but leave F3 at its ML value. Use a beta of
      -0.48 in cell F2 to find the lower limit for p, and -0.46 to find the upper limit. Don't forget to copy/paste
      special the value of p each time to the appropriate Lower or Upper cell (either C14 or C15).</p>
