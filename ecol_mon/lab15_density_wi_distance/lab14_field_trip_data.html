    <h1>Analysis of field trip data: density estimation, vegetation sampling</h1>
    <p>We will spend today analyzing the data we collected in the field last
      week.</p>
    <p>We collected data on density of rocks, using 1 m fixed width transects
      and using distance sampling truncated to 100 m. We can also treat the data
      as a 100 m fixed width transect. We will calculate density estimates for
      each, and compare them.</p>
    <p>We collected vegetation data using relevé's, and using line intercept
      sampling. We will quantify the shrub cover and patch sizes that we
      estimated with the relevé's and see how they compare.</p>
    <h2>Density estimates</h2>
    <h3>Transect lengths</h3>
    <p>For all of the density estimates we will need to know how long our
      transect was. We will get this by plotting our start and end points (which
      we recorded in the field using a GPS) in ArcMap, and then we will measure
      the distance along the trail we walked.</p>
    <p>1. Open Excel, and enter the start and end points. In row 1, use the
      column headings "Type", "Which", "Easting", "Northing" (for columns A, B,
      and C). The type will be either burned or unburned. Which will be either
      start or end. You should have a starting and ending point for each plot
      type. Enter the easting and northing for each from the class data set
      (it's in the "Distance sampling start and end UTM's" database). Save the
      file on your H: drive, in a file called "utms".</p>
    <p>2. Open ArcMap. Add the World_Imagery.lyr file from the P: drive (in the
      basemaps folder). Now, add the Excel file you just made - double-click the
      file name until you get the list of worksheets, and select Sheet1$ to use.</p>
    <p>Now, right-click on Sheet1$ in the table of contents, and select "Display
      XY data". Select Easting as the x-field, and Northing as the y-field. For
      the Coordinate System of Input Coordinates, click "Edit...", and type UTM
      in the search bar. Under WGS84, Northern Hemisphere, find WGS 1984 UTM
      Zone 11N, and click OK.</p>
    <p>Click OK again to make the points.</p>
    <p>3. Zoom to the points. If you right-click on the "Sheet1$Events" that
      were created, you can zoom to the layer and see the points marking the
      start and end points of our sample.</p>
    <p>4. Use the "Measure" tool (the little ruler with arrows over it) to
      measure the distance between start and end points along the trail. Set the
      distance units to meters, and click frequently enough to follow the curve
      of the trail reasonably well (click more often at curves, less often along
      straight segments). The Length reported is the cumulative length of the
      transect. Do this for both the burned and unburned transects.</p>
    <p>Once you have your transect lengths you're ready to move to the next step
      in estimating density, BUT...before you close down ArcMap, you might as
      well measure the sizes of the plots we veg sampled. Use the same tool, but
      click on the "Measure an area" button, and change the area units to acres.
      Now, click around the outside of the unburned area we sampled. You don't
      have to be particularly precise here, all we need to know is whether we
      were right that the patch is over 5 acres (which is what we recorded on
      the relevé sheet). Do the same for the patch of burned area (which is
      adjacent to the unburned patch, across the trail - you can just use the
      portion that is surrounded by walking trails).</p>
    <h3>Fixed width transects</h3>
    <p>Now that you know the lengths of the transects, you can calculate density
      of rocks of the fixed-width counts.</p>
    <p>1. Calculate the areas. The area of the 1 m wide transect is 1 m x
      transect length in m. Treating the distance sampling counts as a
      fixed-width transect, the area would be 100 m x transect length in m.</p>
    <p>2. Divide number of rocks by transect area. You can get the number of
      rocks for the 1 m fixed width counts from the "Fixed width transect"
      database. Divide this number by the transect area to get rocks per square
      meter.</p>
    <p>I will post a class data set for distance sampling, and you can count the
      number of rocks seen within 100 m of the trail from that. Divide that
      number by the area of the 100 m transect to get rocks per square meter.</p>
    <h3>Distance sampling</h3>
    <p>We will use the R statistical package to get our distance sampling
      estimates. If you haven't encountered R already, it's an "open source"
      statistical analysis package. Open source software is typically developed
      by teams of volunteers, and the "source code" that programmers use to
      develop the software is made available to anyone who wants to view and
      modify it. Since the code is available for free, the executable version of
      open source software is usually distributed free of charge as well. One of
      the side effects of this development strategy is that users who are also
      programmers often contribute their own modifications and add-ons for free,
      in a "share and share alike" manner. The base R package has most of the
      statistical analysis types you already know about, but contributions from
      users have vastly increased the types of analyses that R can do.</p>
    <p>One such contributed "extension" for R is a package called "unmarked"
      which includes, among other things, distance sampling functions.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, when I tried to install this package on the university
      computers it wouldn't work. Some of the packages that unmarked relies on
      need to be updated, and I couldn't get it done in time for class. I will
      do this analysis on my own computer, and give you the output for you to
      look at.</p>
    <p>What we can do, though, is look at whether there is a distinct dropoff in
      numbers of rocks with distance. Download the class data Excel file, and do
      a pivot table that counts the number of rocks in each distance class for
      burned and unburned plots. You can then do a bar chart of these counts by
      distance class to see if the numbers decline with increasing distance.</p>
    <h2>Vegetation sampling</h2>
    <p>We used the CNPS field forms to collect Releve's of our burned and
      unburned areas. The Releve's are quick, and semi-quantitative, but we need
      to check our eyeballometrically recorded cover classes against the
      estimates we derive from our line transects. </p>
    <p>The specific pieces of information we collected that we can check are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shrub stage (based on percent dead)</li>
      <li>Percent vascular veg cover</li>
      <li>Percent shrub cover</li>
      <li>Percent cover by shrub species</li>
      <li>Stand size</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The stand size we have already checked with ArcMap.</p>
    <p>Percent overall shrub cover, vascular veg cover, and cover by shrub
      species will all come from the line intercept data. The percent living and
      dead will also come the line intercept data, but in a separate summary
      table that groups the data by living or dead.</p>
    <p>1. Download the class Excel worksheet. I will make a dataset that uses
      consistent species names, and will post it on the class web site.</p>
    <p>2. Calculate the amount of the transects covered by each species. In the
      worksheet, you will have data on the amount of the tape covered by each
      shrub (which will just be the end measurement minus the start
      measurement). You can make a pivot table that sums these amounts by
      transect and species (use transect ID as row names, species as column
      names, and use the amount covered as the data field).</p>
    <p>Once you have the table, set up a table below with the same row anc
      column headings. In the body of the table, divide the sums in your pivot
      table by the length of the transects. This will give you a proportion
      covered by species for each transect. Some will equal zero, which is fine.</p>
    <p>3. Calculate the total of vascular plants and of shrubs. In the next
      column to the right of your proportions (which you just calculated for 2)
      enter the column name "Vascular", and sum the proportions of all the
      vascular plants (which I believe will be everything we sampled). In the
      next column over, enter the column name "Shrubs", and sum the shrub
      species.</p>
    <p>4. Calculate means and confidence intervals for burned and unburned. Two
      rows below the bottom of the table of proportions, label column A
      "Burned". Skip a row, and in the next five rows write "Mean", "s", "n",
      "Lower", and "Upper".</p>
    <p>Next to the Mean label in column A, calculate the average of the burned
      transects for buckwheat (which should be in column B). In the next row
      down, next to the s label, calculate the standard deviation for burned
      transects with the =stdev() function. In the next row, calculate the
      number of burned transects with the =count() function.</p>
    <p>You can calculate the lower limit as mean - t x s / sqrt(n). You can get
      the t-value with =tinv(0.05, n-1), but replace n-1 with the number of
      transects minus 1. The upper limit is the same formula, but change the
      subtraction to addition.</p>
    <p>5. Compare the means and confidence intervals to our Releve values.
      Ideally, the mean proportions should be inside of the cover classes we
      recorded, but if not then at least the 95% confidence intervals should
      overlap with the cover classes.</p>
    <p>6. Make a pivot table of living/dead shrubs. Make a new pivot table of
      the transect data with the same layout as before, but add living/dead as
      column labels above species. You can turn off species that are not shrubs
      to make the calculation easier.</p>
    <p>Add subtotals for living/dead.</p>
    <p>Then, in the column to the right of the table, calculate the amount of
      dead divided by the sum of living and dead. This will be the proportion
      dead in each transect. Then, you can calculate the mean, s, n, and 95%
      confidence interval for this proportion dead.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Assignment.</h2>
    <p>Upload your Excel sheet with your rock densities and your vegetation
      cover classes.</p>
    <p>Then, write a brief report on how the different estimation methods
      compared. For the rock density estimation, we can expect that distance
      sampling will give us the best estimates, but discuss any problems we may
      have had in the field that could have caused problems (did we meet the
      assumption of 100% detectability at zero distance? What might the fact
      that we couldn't see beyond the top of the hill in the unburned site have
      done to our estimates?).</p>
    <p>For the vegetation data, address how well our quantitative approach
      matched the Releves. Were we right overall? Were we right for every
      species? What were the strengths and weaknesses of each approach (line
      transect and Releve)? Given that we will generally prefer quantitative
      methods whenever possible, when might you want to resort to the
      semi-quantitative rapid assessment approach?</p>
    <p>You should be able to address these issues in about a page for rocks and
      a page for vegetation. Upload the Word document along with the
      spreadsheets.</p>
