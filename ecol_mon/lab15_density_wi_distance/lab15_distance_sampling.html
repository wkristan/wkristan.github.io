    <h1>Density estimation</h1>
    <p>Today we will compare the density estimates obtained using fixed width
      transects and using distance sampling. </p>
    <p>Fixed width sampling is the simpler method - an observer walks a
      transect, and counts all of the individuals observed within a fixed
      distance of the line. The area sampled is simply the length of the line
      multiplied by twice the distance:</p>
    <p><img alt="Fixed width" src="fixed.png" style="float:left"> Consider this
      example - the green circles are coast horned lizards for which we want a
      density estimate. The black line is the transect line we would walk along,
      and it is 100 m long. We would record every lizard within 5 m of the line,
      so the area surveyed is: </p>
    <p>A = 100 x 5 x 2 = 1000 m<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Within this fixed width transect there are 14 lizards, so the density of
      lizards would be estimated as:</p>
    <p>D̂ = n / A = 14/1000 = 0.014 lizards per square meter</p>
    <p>To express this as lizards per hectare, we could multiply by the number
      of square meters per hectare (10000), which gives us the estimate as 140
      lizards per hectare.</p>
    <p>The problem with fixed-width samples, however, is that they assume that
      every individual that is within the transect is detected. This is probably
      reasonable if the transect width is narrow, but as the width of the
      transect increases it becomes increasingly unlikely to be true. If some of
      the individuals in the transect are missed the density estimate will be
      biased low, so to be effective fixed-width transects have to be narrow.</p>
    <p>But, narrow transects sample a smaller area for a given transect length.
      A small area sampled means few lizards detected, which would lead to
      variable, imprecise estimates of density.</p>
    <p><img alt="Distance hist" src="distance_hist.png" style="margin-right: 20px; float:left">
      Distance sampling solves the detectability problem by modeling changes in
      detectability with increasing distance. In distance sampling, every
      individual detected is counted, and its perpendicular distance from the
      line is also measured, but it is assumed that not every individual present
      was actually seen.</p>
    <p>The distribution of detection distances is used to measure the change in
      detectability with distance. The line fitted to the distribution of
      distances in the graph to the left illustrates the approach - if the
      actual density is constant throughout the region then the decline in
      numbers of detections with distance is purely due to a change in
      detectability, so once we know how detectability changes we can adjust for
      the animals not seen.</p>
    <br style="clear:both">
    <p>The equation for the population density estimate is <img alt="Density from distance"
        src="density_from_dist.png">; n is the number of individuals counted,
      and L is the length of the transect. The detection function is f(x), and
      f(0) refers to the value of the function when 0 is plugged in (in other
      words, f(0) is f(x) evaluated at 0). The detection function evaluated at
      zero is the inverse of the <strong>effective width</strong>, which refers
      to the equivalent width of a fixed-width transect sampled with perfect
      detectability. If f(0) is the inverse of the effective width, then <img alt="Effective width"
        src="eff_width.png"> is the estimate of effective width. </p>
    <p>Using effective width instead of f(0) makes the estimator <img alt="Dens dist eff"
        src="density_from_dist_effective.png">, which looks just like the
      formula for density in a fixed width transect, except that effective width
      is used in place of the fixed width of the transect. Distance sampling
      estimates the curve that describes the reduction in detectability with
      distance, uses it to estimate effective width, and then calculates the
      density from the number of individuals observed, the length of the
      transect, and the effective width.</p>
    <p>Distance sampling is great stuff - it's clever and sophisticated, and
      improves on fixed width estimates. However, like any estimation method, it
      makes some assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detection probability is assumed to be 1 at a distance of 0 - in other
        words, if a lizard is right on the line it will be detected. This isn't
        always true; species that dive under water, or hide in burrows, or are
        very cryptic and difficult to see could go undetected as you move right
        over them. If you know this is the case and can estimate the probability
        of detecting individuals right on the line you can correct for this, but
        otherwise the method under-estimates the actual density (so would fixed
        width samples, but still).</li>
      <li>Density is homogeneous throughout the area surveyed - no moving
        between habitats, no gradients in population density from one end of the
        transect to the other, and the transect is in the same habitat for its
        entire length.</li>
      <li>The detection function fits the data well, meaning that it describes
        the decline in detectability accurately - but, it doesn't have to fit
        too well to improve on fixed width estimates. Correcting for the dropoff
        in detectability with distance is good, even if it is done imperfectly.
        The app I wrote for you uses the positive side of the normal
        distribution.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Today's activity</h2>
    <p> I put together a simulation for you to use, which can open in a separate
      window by clicking <a href="dist_sampling_javascript/dist_sampling_exercise.html"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p> Once the link opens, you will see a blank table of density estimates at
      the top, and a map of an area of California desert somewhere not too far
      from here.</p>
    <p>The transect length is set initially to 100 (m) and the distance visible
      is set to 20 (m). When you click the "Select transect" button for the
      first time a transect 100 m long is placed on the map, and the horned
      lizards detected are shown as colored dots. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red dots are horned lizards detected with distance sampling</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The number of lizards detected by distance sampling is in row n
          under the Dist. column.</li>
        <li>A curve is fitted to the distances for the detected lizards by the
          app, and the curve is used to calculate f(0). From f(0) the effective
          width of the transect is calculated, and is reported in the sub-title
          of the graph.</li>
        <li>Density is calculated as number detected divided by effective width
          x transect length, which is then multiplied by 10,000 to convert to
          number per hectare. This estimated density is in the Density row.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The green dots are lizards that were detected in a fixed-width
        transect 5 m on either side of the line (10 m wide total).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the lizards in this transect are detected, and are in the n
          row of the FW column.</li>
        <li>Density is based on the count of lizards detected divided by 10 x
          transect length, which is then multiplied by 10,000 to convert to
          number of lizards per hectare. This is reported in in the Density row.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The histogram shows the distribution of distances from the line for
        the lizards detected, with the curve overlaid. The effective width,
        which is 1/f(0), is displayed in the graph sub-title.</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If you click on the "Select transect" button a second time, you'll see
      that a new transect is selected, with a new distance sample and a new
      fixed width sample. The density estimates update to reflect this new
      sample.</p>
    <p>There are two properties of the sampling that you can change:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The maximum distance that individuals are detectable - changing the
        distance detectable only affects the distance sampling estimates,
        because the fixed width sampling is always set to 10 m in this
        simulation.</li>
      <li>The length of the transect - changing the length of the transect
        affects both distance sampling and fixed width sampling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The activity for today is to try out a range of detection distances, and
      a range of transect lengths, and see how distance sampling estimates and
      fixed width transect estimates compare. Download <a href="dist_sampling.xlsx">this
        worksheet</a> to your S: drive, and use it to record your results.
      You'll see that the Data worksheet is already laid out for you with
      lengths of transects and distances, you just need to fill in with survey
      results. </p>
    <p>1. <strong>Varying detection distance</strong>. Keeping the length of
      transect at 100, with the Distance detectable to 20 m, click "Select
      transect" and record the five statistics for this combination of distance
      and transect length in your worksheet. The button below the table of
      density estimates, labeled "Copy estimates", copies all of the things you
      need to record for each run in a format that can be pasted directly into
      the spreadsheet, so all you will need to do is to set the transect lengths
      and detection distances to values given below, select the transect, and
      then copy and paste the values into Excel.</p>
    <p>Repeat four more times at 20 m, and then repeat the process for detection
      distances of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>50</li>
      <li>100</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you are working through this part of the activity watch the histogram
      on the left side of the simulation - you should see that more lizards are
      detected as your visibility increases, and this gives you a better match
      between the bars of the histogram and the detection function. Given how
      important that detection function is to a distance sampling estimate of
      density, you might anticipate better estimates as the visibility
      increases.</p>
    <p>Before you move on, think about detectability - we are able to set
      detection distance to any value we want in a simulation like this one, but
      how much control would you have over it in nature? You can influence
      detectability through your sampling methods - you can use binoculars, you
      can survey when the animals are most active (dawn for songbirds, nighttime
      for frogs, etc.), you can avoid days with poor visibility (high wind,
      rain, fog, etc.). However, detectability is also strongly influenced by
      factors that are beyond your control, like environmental conditions
      (whether the area is heavily vegetated, whether there are leaves on the
      trees) and by how cryptic the organisms you're surveying are.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Varying transect length</strong>. Set the detection distance
      back to 20 m, and set the transect length to 200 m. Generate 5 transects
      for 20 m detection distance, then 5 for 50 m detection distance, and 5 for
      100 m detection distance. Remember to copy the estimates and paste them
      into your Excel sheet each time (if you start seeing duplicated rows you
      forgot to copy the estimates before pasting - don't ask how I know that -
      so generate a new transect and copy/paste over one of the duplicates if
      this happens to you).</p>
    <p>Then set the transect length to 400 m, and then use the 20, 50, and 100 m
      detection distances for that transect length (five each).</p>
    <p>Again, watch the histogram - longer transects will give you more points
      at a given detection distance. The n.fw values go up as well. You might
      thus expect longer transects will give you better estimates.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that this is actually the parameter you have the most
      control over when you are monitoring. The length of the transect is an
      investigator's choice, within limits. For example, longer transects are
      more likely to cross over into a different habitat that has a different
      density of organisms, which would run afoul of the constant density
      assumption. There may also be boundaries on the study area or barriers to
      movement that can't be gotten around. But, within these broad constraints,
      any transect length can be used.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>3. <strong>Squared differences from true density</strong>. Once you have
      your results in your Excel spreadsheet (which you should SAVE NOW), you
      need to do two more calculations before you can analyze the data. We know
      what the actual density of dots on the map is, and we need to assess how
      close our estimates were to the correct number. We will calculate a
      statistic called the "root mean square error", or RMSE, to measure this.
      The calculation is like a standard deviation, but we use the known density
      instead of the mean of the data:</p>
    <img alt="rmse" src="rmse.png">
    <p>The hat-D's are the estimates, and D is the known density. The formula
      calculates the average of the squared differences between the estimates
      and the true value, and then takes the square root of the average. There
      are 9600 animals (mostly hidden) on a map that is 1200 m by 1600 m, or
      9600/(1200x1600) = 0.005 lizards per square meter. Multiplying by 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>/ha
      gives us <strong>50 lizards per hectare</strong> - this is the true value
      of density, D. We will use PivotTables to calculate the averages, so for
      now we just need the squared differences for each of our estimates.</p>
    <p>In cell H1 type "Density.sqdiff", and in cell i1 type "FW.sqdiff". In H2
      enter the formula:</p>
    <p>=(d2-50)^2</p>
    <p>and in I2 enter:</p>
    <p>=(g2-50)^2</p>
    <p>Copy and paste cells H2 and i2 down to the rest of the rows. Now you're
      ready for some pivot tables.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Summarizing distance sampling density estimates with a
        PivotTable</strong>. Select cell A1, and insert a PivotTable. Let Excel
      put the table in a new worksheet.</p>
    <p>We'll do the distance sampling data first:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Put "Length of transect" into the rows</li>
      <li>Put "Distance" into the columns</li>
      <li>Drag Density.dist into the Σ values, and change the value field to
        Average. These are the average density estimates for your five
        replicates at each combination of distance and transect length.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have your new worksheet with your PivotTable, change the name of
      the new worksheet to "Pivot" (double-click on its tab and change the name
      to Pivot).</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Summarizing fixed width sampling estimates with a PivotTable</strong>.
      Switch back to sheet Data. Select cell A1 again, and insert another
      PivotTable, but this time use the Existing Worksheet option and put it in
      the Pivot worksheet, in cell A15.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the Length of transect into the Rows, but this time don't bother
        with the Distance column - detection distance wasn't part of fixed width
        transect estimates, so we don't need to account for it here. </li>
      <li>Drag Density.fw into the Σ values area, and change the value field to
        an Average. These are the average densities for fixed width sampling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. <strong>Collect results</strong>. We will be making several different
      PivotTables, so we need to record results - add a new worksheet, and
      change its name to "Results". </p>
    <p>Back in sheet Pivot, select the first PivotTable in cells A3 through E8,
      copy, and paste special as values in the Results sheet in cell A5. In cell
      A1 enter the label "Distance sampling", and in cell A3 type "Average
      density".</p>
    <p>Switch to Pivot, copy your fixed width density estimates from A15 to B19,
      switch to Results and paste-special as values to cell H6. In cell H1 type
      "Fixed width transect".</p>
    <p>You can change the label in cells A6 and H6 to "Transect length" (do this
      for each of the pivot tables you put into Results).</p>
    <p>7. <strong>Number of lizards detected</strong>. Back to sheet Pivot.
      Keep the same layout for each pivot table, but take out the densities, and
      put in the number of points detected - this will be n.dist for the
      distance sampling pivot table, and n.fw for the fixed width transect pivot
      table. Set the value fields to calculate averages.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste-special the values for the distance sampling pivot table,
      into the Results sheet in cell A14. Type "Number of points" in cell A12.
      Copy and paste-special the fixed width pivot table into cell H15.</p>
    <p>8. <strong>Effective width of distance samples</strong>. Back in sheet
      Pivot, calculate the average effective width for distance sampling - take
      out the n.dist field from Σ values, and put in Eff.width.dist. Change it
      to an average.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste this table to Results, cell A23. Enter "Effective width"
      in cell A21. We didn't need to estimate an effective width for fixed width
      sampling, because the width was always 10 m.</p>
    <p>9. <strong>RMSE of estimates</strong>. Back in sheet Pivot, take out
      Eff.width.dist from Σ values, and put in Density.sqdiff, and change it to
      an average. Do the same for fixed width - take out n.fw, and put in
      FW.sqdiff and change it to an average. Copy the distance sampling table
      from Pivot, and paste-special as values in Results cell A32. Copy the
      fixed width table and paste-special in cell H33 of Results.</p>
    <p>Enter the label "Mean squared differences" in cell A30.</p>
    <p>We're not quite done with this calculation though - we need square roots
      of these values.</p>
    <p>So, in cell A39 enter "Root mean square error". We will want to use the
      same layout as the tables we have been copying and pasting, so as a
      convenient way to get the layout all at once copy the mean squared
      difference table (cells A32 to E37), and paste it into A41.</p>
    <p>Then, in the first cell of data (B43) enter the formula =sqrt(b34) - this
      will take the square root of the mean squared error from B34. Copy and
      paste this cell to the rest of the cells in the table to complete the RMSE
      calculation for distance sampling.</p>
    <p>Do the same for fixed width - copy the table from H33 to I37, paste it to
      H42, and then replace the table entries with formulas that calculate the
      square roots.</p>
    <p>10. <strong>Graph the results</strong>. To make the comparison between
      the methods easier, we need to graph each of the results. The names on the
      graph will come from column names, so change the fixed width column labels
      to FW for all of the results in column I (cells I6, I15, and I42).</p>
    <p>Then to make a graph of the average densities, do the following:</p>
    <video controls="controls" style="width: 800px; float:left; margin-right: 30px">
      <source src="graph_of_estimates.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the length of transects to text, so that they will be used as
        labels - enter an apostrophe before each number, and when you hit ENTER
        it will left-justify and gain a little green triangle in the upper left
        corner indicating it is now text.</li>
      <li>Select the cells from A6 to D9, hold down the CTRL key and select
        cells i6 to i9.</li>
      <li>Insert a line graph with both lines and dots (line graphs have a
        categorical x-axis, which is what we will be using here).</li>
      <li>Select one of the lines, right-click and select "Select data"</li>
      <li>Switch the rows and columns so that transect lengths are on the
        x-axis, and detection distances and FW are the four data series</li>
      <li>Change the chart title to "Estimates"</li>
      <li>Add axis labels, and change the x-axis to "Transect length", and the
        y-axis to "Density"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll see that all of the methods give fairly consistent estimates of
      density on average. This shows that both of the methods are unbiased.</p>
    <br style="clear:both">
    <p>Repeat these steps to get graphs of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of points</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The y-axis will be "Number of points", and the title should be
          "Number of points".</li>
        <li>Look at how extending the transect length increases the number of
          points detected for both methods, and how increasing the detection
          distance increases the number of points detected for distance
          sampling. The number of points detected is a major determinant of the
          precision of estimates, so distance sampling has a big advantage in
          this regard.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Effective width</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Effective width only pertains to distance sampling, so you only need
          to select the distance sampling columns.</li>
        <li>Since we don't have a FW column for this graph Excel gets confused
          and doesn't realize the first row are labels, so we need to convert
          them to text. Add an apostrophe before the visibility numbers, '20,
          '50 and '100 - otherwise, use the same steps as for the other graphs.</li>
        <li>The y-axis title and chart title are "Effective width". You should
          see that the transect length doesn't have much effect on effective
          width (the lines should be pretty flat), but the longer the detection
          distances the wider the effective width. Fixed width transects are
          always the same width (10 m in this example).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>RMSE</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The x-axis label is "Transect length", and the y-axis and chart
          title should be "RMSE"</li>
        <li>RMSE is comparing the estimates to the true density - smaller values
          are better precision. If you see from your chart of average densities
          that the values are close to 50 on average, but that the method has a
          high RMSE, that should tell you that the method is accurate but not
          precise. You should see that distance sampling is not better than
          fixed-width sampling (and may even be worse) with 20 m detection
          distances, but with longer detection distances it gives more
          consistent estimates, with lower RMSE, than fixed-width samples. If
          you look at the number of points graph, you get similar numbers of
          points with distance sampling and fixed-width sampling with a small
          detection distance, so better precision is not to be expected. With
          bigger detection distances the number of points detected increases,
          and distance sampling begins to out-perform fixed-width sampling.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You should see that distance sampling does better than fixed width
      sampling usually, particularly when the detection distance is 50 or 100.
      You should also see that increasing the transect length is generally a
      good thing for the accuracy of your samples - the RMSE tends to go down
      with increasing transect length for both methods, because longer transects
      mean more detections (your graph of detections should show an increase as
      the transect length increases, or as the detectability increases).</p>
    <p>It's difficult to tell with just one set of estimates, but both distance
      sampling and fixed width sampling is unbiased - the estimates are correct
      on average. Your estimated densities should be around 50 for both methods
      at all transect lengths and detection distances. What changes is the
      variability in the estimates, and there distance sampling is usually
      better.</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
