      <h2 class="part" id="intro">Spreadsheets as Swiss Army Knives</h2>
      <img style="width: 209px; height: 178px; float: left;" alt="Swiss army knife"
        src="swiss-army-knife.jpg">
      <p>Excel is the spreadsheet program produced by Microsoft. Spreadsheets
        are extremely versatile tools for managing, graphing, and analyzing
        data. Nearly anything you would want to do with data can be done with a
        spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are also relatively easy to use, compared to
        other options available.</p>
      <p>However, the versatility of spreadsheets comes at a cost. More
        specialized tools exist that can do each of the things that Excel does
        better than Excel.</p>
      <p>For example, we will be using Excel to enter and manage data. Database
        management programs (such as Microsoft's own personal database program,
        Access) can store larger data sets more efficiently, and allow users to
        interact with data with less potential for data loss or corruption.</p>
      <p>We will be using Excel to graph data. There are dedicated graphing
        programs (like SigmaPlot) that can produce a much larger range of
        graphs, and can handle plotting of grouped data much better than Excel.</p>
      <p>We will be using Excel for statistical data analysis. There are better
        statistical analysis programs (like MINITAB and R) that are faster,
        support specialized types of analysis, and offer graph types that
        support statistical data analysis better (such as normal probability
        plots and histograms).</p>
      <p>We will use Excel for numerical analysis. There are better programs for
        numerical analysis (such as MatLab) that are faster and more efficient
        than Excel.</p>
      <p>We will use Excel to write a genetic drift simulation model. There are
        programming languages (like C++ and Python) that will run a simulation
        much faster than Excel.</p>
      <p>But, none of these specialized tools can do all of these functions as
        simply as Excel. Because of its versatility, no matter what you do when
        you leave CSUSM, if your career is at all related to the biological
        sciences you will almost certainly encounter Excel on the job.</p>
      <h2 id="anatomy_spreadsheet" class="part">Basic anatomy of a worksheet</h2>
      <div id="worksheetmap"> <a href="#" id="columnIndex" class="tooltip"><span>Column
            index - capital letters</span></a> <a href="#" id="rowIndex" class="tooltip"><span>Row
            index - numbers</span></a> <a href="#" id="cells" class="tooltip"><span>Cells
            - each cell can be referenced by its column index and row index (the
            upper left cell is A1).</span></a> <a href="#" id="formula" class="tooltip"><span>Formula
            bar - the contents of the selected cell can be edited here.</span></a></div>
      <p>In a spreadsheet program like Excel, data is entered into a worksheet,
        that is made up of a grid of <strong>cells</strong> organized in rows
        and columns. You can refer to a cell in the worksheet by its row and
        column index - columns are indexed by letters at the top of each column,
        and rows are indexed by numbers to the left of each row. Cell A1 is
        selected in this screen shot.</p>
      <p>The formula bar is the blank area above the columns, starting at column
        D. The selected cell contents will appear and can be edited here. As you
        will see, sometimes what shows in a cell is the result of a calculation,
        and if you select the cell the formula will appear here while the cell
        itself displays the result of the calculation.</p>
      <p>If you hover over the formula bar, column index letters, row index
        numbers, or cells in the worksheet a tooltip will pop up to identify it.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 id="excel_interface" class="part" style="clear: both;">Basic anatomy
        of Excel's interface</h2>
      <p>Much of Excel's functionality can be accessed through its <strong>ribbon
          interface</strong>. This is the name for the grouped sets of buttons
        along the top of the Excel window. Sets of buttons are grouped by type
        of operation, with a label below identifying the button group. Buttons
        are further grouped into named tabs by task - the tabs are File, Home,
        Insert, Page Layout, and so on. By default when you start Excel the Home
        tab is selected, and the buttons available are shown here: </p>
      <div id="homebuttonmap"> <a href="#" id="clpbd" class="tooltip"><span>Clipboard
            - copy, paste editing tools</span></a> <a href="#" id="font" class="tooltip"><span>Font
            - change font style, color, size</span></a> <a href="#" id="algnmt"
          class="tooltip"><span>Alignment - alignment of cell contents</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="number" class="tooltip"><span>Number - formatting of
            numbers, including style (money, percent) and number of decimals
            displayed</span></a> <a href="#" id="celltools" class="tooltip"><span>Cells
            - inserting, deleting, formating cells</span></a> <a href="#" id="editing"
          class="tooltip"><span>Editing - summing cells, filling a series,
            sorting and filtering</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both">Button groups that are important to us will pop up
        a tooltip explaining what they are for as you hover over the picture
        above. The "clipboard" group has buttons that handle copying and pasting
        operations, the "font" group has buttons for all things related to
        styling and coloring text, and so on.</p>
      <p>If you click on the next named tab, "<strong>Insert</strong>", you'll
        see a different set of buttons.</p>
      <div id="insertbuttonmap"> <a href="#" id="pivot" class="tooltip"><span>Pivot
            tables - insert a pivot table</span></a> <a href="#" id="chart" class="tooltip"><span>Chart
            - insert a new chart</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both;">Buttons on the "insert" ribbon handle inserting
        (among other things) PivotTables and graphs. We'll use graphs later this
        semester, but today we will focus on PivotTables, which are a powerful
        tool for summarizing data. To make use of PivotTables, we need to use a
        particular data organization called "stacked data". We'll learn what
        that means now.</p>
      <h2 id="data_org" class="part">Data organization</h2>
      <p>Spreadsheets give you a great deal of flexibility in choosing how to
        organize your data. One consequence of this flexibility is that Excel
        provides you with no guidance about organizing data to make it easy to
        manage and analyze. Although any number of ways of entering data are
        possible they are not equally good, and choosing a good data
        organization makes the rest of your work much easier.</p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Bad idea" src="bad_data.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>For example, we will (shortly) be working with some
                measurements made on leaves picked from a tree, and from leaves
                picked up off of the ground. The example to the right shows six
                measurements of masses of leaves in each group, and color is
                used to indicate whether they are taken directly from the tree
                or from the ground.</p>
              <p>Hopefully it is obvious that this example is a particularly bad
                choice for a data organization scheme (in fact, it is probably
                an overstatement to call it an "organization" scheme at all).
                The color coding makes it possible to see which numbers are from
                which group, but trying to do any sort of analysis on these data
                would be difficult.</p>
              <p>This isn't meant to be a realistic option for data entry, but
                rather it's an illustration of the fact that because Excel lets
                you enter your data any way you want it is possible to get it
                very wrong.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Little less bad" src="less_bad_data.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>We can improve on the chaos of the first approach by grouping
                the data together into blocks, grouped by the source of the
                leaves, and ditch the color coding. We can then label the two
                different sets of data in a nearby cell to make it clear what
                each block of data represents.</p>
              <p>This looks a little bit better - it's certainly less chaotic -
                but think about why it looks better.</p>
              <p>First, having the data values belonging to each group entered
                in a contiguous block makes it easier to see the values all at
                once, and to compare them. Comparison is a fundamental operation
                in the sciences, and having data organized in a way that
                comparisons between groups can be easily made is always a good
                thing.</p>
              <p>If you wanted to take an average of each group it wouldn't be
                difficult. We will learn more about spreadsheet formulas in a
                couple of weeks, but for now it's enough to know that we can
                calculate an average by identifying a range of cells that
                contain the numbers, and having them all together in a block
                makes that easy to do.</p>
              <p>But, you may be surprised to find out that this is only <em>
                  slightly</em> better than the chaos method when it comes to
                managing and analyzing data.</p>
              <p>The disadvantage of this method is that it doesn't make good
                use of the rows and columns. As you learned in biostats,
                scientists collect data by defining <strong>variables</strong>
                as measurements of specific properties of some component of a
                system we're studying. We also need to replicate our
                measurements, which means that we use more than one experimental
                subject, and measure the variables we are using on each subject.
                When we have data from a variable that we want to enter into a
                worksheet, we can make use of the rows and columns to help us
                keep track of what variable the data represents, and what
                individual subject the data pertains to.<br>
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Unstacked data" src="unstacked.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>A better alternative to entering the data in blocks is to use
                an <strong>unstacked</strong> organization. In this
                organization, a column is used to hold all of the data from
                leaves on the ground, and another is used for all of the data
                from leaves on the tree. You can see that the columns are
                labeled, and the labels identify two different variables - one
                identifies what the numbers represent (mass), and the other
                identifies the level of the grouping variable that each column
                belongs to (categorical variable "type" with levels "ground" or
                "tree").</p>
              <p>This is one of the two common organizations used for
                statistical data analysis - you might recognize it from
                biostats, because it was one of the two data organization types
                that were supported by MINITAB. It isn't the one that I
                recommend, though.</p>
              <p>The primary problem with the unstacked approach is that while
                it uses columns to indicate the groups that the leaves belong
                to, the rows don't carry any meaning. For example, the first row
                of data (in row 2 of the worksheet) has a 0.4 for the mass of
                the first leaf from the ground, and 4 for the first leaf from a
                tree, but there is no reason for these two leaves to be sitting
                next to each other - the measurements are from two different
                leaves, and they aren't paired in any way, so we could rearrange
                the numbers in column A while leaving the values in column B
                alone, and it wouldn't matter. Consequently, the fact that these
                two leaves are in the same row tells us nothing useful.</p>
              <p>This isn't a problem if the only thing we wanted to know about
                these leaves is how much they weighed, but we may have multiple
                pieces of information that we want to record about each leaf. If
                we had data on both the mass of each leaf and the length of each
                leaf, how would we add the length information in a way that made
                it clear which measurements were for the same leaf?</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><img alt="Stacked data" src="stacked_data.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
              <p>The data organization in which both rows and columns are
                meaningful, and that I thus recommend, is <strong>stacked</strong>
                data. You can see an example to the right - now each column is a
                different variable (with mass in column A, and the leaf type,
                which is either tree or ground, in column G), and each row is a
                single leaf. Both the row and column that a data point is in
                carries information now - the row identifies which leaf the
                measurement is from, and the column identifies the variable.</p>
              <p>One of the huge advantages of stacked data is that it is the
                most flexible, easiest organization method for analysis of data
                in Excel. When data sets are organized this way it's possible to
                take advantage of data analysis features like sorting,
                filtering, and (most importantly) PivotTables.</p>

      <p id="entering_data" class="part">The take-home message is this: When you
        used MINITAB in biostats, each column had to be a variable type (either
        numeric or text), and you were limited to using either an unstacked or a
        stacked organization - chaos was not an option. In that way, MINITAB's
        lack of flexibility prevented you from using a data entry scheme that
        would cause you problems. Excel doesn't prevent you from using data
        entry schemes that you will regret, so you will need to choose a good
        approach on your own. I recommend using stacked data.</p>
      <h2 id="enter_extract" class="part">Exercise - entering data, extracting
        data, re-arranging data, summarizing data in Excel.</h2>
      <p>Before you get started, create a folder called "biol365" at the root of
        your H drive. Within that folder, create a folder called "ex1". It's
        very important that you set this up correctly to make sure the
        instructions for these exercises work for you.</p>
      <p>Download this file, called "<a href="leaf_data.xls">leaf_data.xls</a>",
        to your h-drive (in folder H:/biol365/ex1). Make sure you save the file
        first! If you open in Excel before you save it, you may have problems
        (possible software crash, difficulty finding your work later after
        you've saved it, etc.). The file contains measurements of several
        variables from 103 sycamore leaves that were either collected from the
        ground, or picked live from a tree.</p>
      <p>If you open the file in Excel, you'll see that it is organized as
        stacked data. Each row is a single leaf, and each column is a variable
        measured. The names of the variables are mass, petiole.diam (diameter of
        the petiole in mm - the petiole is the small stem that attaches the leaf
        to the branch), max.vein.len (length of the longest vein in mm),
        num.veins (a count of the number of veins in the leaf), leaf.thick
        (thickess of the leaf in mm), max.width (width of the leaf at its widest
        point, in mm), and type (T for leaves picked from the tree, and G for
        leaves collected from the ground).</p>
      As you work through the exercise, bear in mind that <strong>undo is your
        friend</strong>! The left-curved arrow,<img alt="Undo" src="undo.png">,
      at the upper left corner of the window is the "undo" button (the
      right-curved arrow is the "redo" button). If you make a mistake (such as
      deleting something you didn't mean to, or sorting something incorrectly)
      you can click the undo button and most of the time you can reverse your
      mistake. Clicking the button will undo the most recent operation, and
      clicking repeatedly will undo in the order that you executed the
      operations. Clicking and dropping down the undo list allows you to select
      a particular operation to undo, out of order.
      <h3 id="filtering" class="part">A. Filtering and extracting data</h3>
      <p>We are going to start today by learning some of Excel's features that
        help you enter and manipulate data. We'll start with filtering.</p>
      <p><input name="Checkbox1" type="checkbox">1. <strong>Turn on
          auto-filtering</strong>. Select one of the headings (any one, like
        "mass" in cell A1), and click and hold "Sort &amp; Filter" on the right
        side of the button bar - when the menu drops down select "Filter" (<a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="filter.png">like this</a><span class="ipt">like
          this<span class="ip"><img src="filter.png"></span></span>). You'll see
        that this puts a drop-down menu button on each of the column headings in
        the data set. As long as all the data are contiguous (meaning, no blank
        rows or columns) Excel will find all the variables and turn filtering on
        for all of them. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><input name="checkbox2" type="checkbox">2. <strong>Filter the leaves
          picked from the tree</strong>. Click on the down-arrow on the "type"
        variable (in cell G1) - you'll see that all the unique values in this
        column are identified (T, G), with a check box next to each of them.
        Un-check the box next to G, so that only T is selected, and click "OK".
        You'll see that only the T leaves are showing. To help you remember that
        you're filtering the data, the icon in the drop-down menu box has
        changed to show a filter icon, and the row numbers have turned blue and
        are no longer sequential numbers - they still represent the row numbers
        from the entire data set, but the rows with G leaves are hidden.</p>
      <p>This is just a temporary change to how the data are displayed, and
        everything will be back to normal when you turn filtering off. If you
        want to extract the data for T, you can select all the cells, copy, and
        paste to a new worksheet. To do this, you will need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select all the cells, right-click, and select "Copy".</li>
        <li>Make a new worksheet by clicking on the + next to the "Sheet1" tab
          at the bottom of the worksheet - it will be called Sheet2.</li>
        <li>Select the upper-left cell of Sheet2 you want to paste to (A1),
          right-click and select "Paste".</li>
      </ul>

        <p>This is a good time to double-check that you know what it means to
          "select" a cell in Excel. Selecting a cell is done by clicking once,
          with the left mouse button. A selected cell looks like this:</p>
        <p><img alt="Selected cell" src="selecting_cell_selected.png"></p>
        <p>A selected cell has a thick line around it, with a small square in
          the lower right called the "fill handle" (which we will make use of
          shortly).</p>
        <p>Sometimes the mouse you use only has one button, and if so it acts
          like a left button on a two-button scroll wheel mouse like the ones we
          have in the computer labs. Left-clicking is much more common an
          operation than right-clicking, so if the instructions only say "click"
          assume they mean "left click".</p>
        <p>If you double-click on a cell, it changes its appearance to this:</p>
        <p><img alt="Activated" src="selecting_cell_activated.png"></p>
        <p>Hopefully you can see that there is a thin vertical line at the left
          side of the cell - this indicates that the cell is activated for
          editing. You don't need to double-click an empty cell to enter data
          into it, you can just select it and start typing. However, if a cell
          already contains something you need to double-click to edit its
          contents, or your typing will replace what is already in the cell. If
          you accidentally enter editing mode, you can get out of it by hitting
          the ENTER key (if you haven't made any changes), or by hitting the
          "ESC" key or by clicking on the red X next to the formula bar, <img alt="Cancel"
            src="cancel_button.png">, if you accidentally made a change and
          don't want it saved in the cell (it doesn't turn red until you hover
          over it).</p>
        <p>When the instructions tell you to "select" a cell, they mean that you
          should left-click into it once. What you are able to do with a cell
          depends on whether you have selected it or activated it for editing,
          so it's important not to do one when you mean to do the other.</p>
        <p>For example, you can select more than one cell at a time by (left)
          clicking on the first cell you want to select and holding the button
          down, then dragging either up, down, right or left to extend the thick
          line to include additional cells, and then releasing the button. This
          only works with selecting - if you have activated the first cell for
          editing, you will not be able to select additional cells before
          getting out of editing mode.</p>
        <h3>Pointer types</h3>
        <p>Excel has a huge set of features, so much so that if Excel's
          interface presented everything it could do all at once it would become
          difficult to find the features that you need for the particular task
          at hand. One of the ways that Excel tries to address this problem is
          by presenting features only when they are needed - that is, what Excel
          presents to you depends on the <strong>context</strong>. We will see
          this frequently throughout the semester - you will see different
          options when you right-click on a cell in your worksheet than when you
          right-click in a graph (the menu that pops up is even called a
          "context menu"), and the tabs in the ribbon interface will change when
          you select a PivotTable or a graph.</p>
        <p>The other thing that depends on context is the pointer type. When you
          are moving your mouse around over the ribbon, or anywhere outside of
          the worksheet cells, the pointer will look like this:<img alt="Ribbon pointer"
            src="pointer_type_ribbon.png"> - this pointer is used to select menu
          items, or to click on buttons in the ribbon.</p>
        <p>When you move your pointer over the cells in the worksheet, it
          changes to this:<img alt="Select" src="pointer_type_select.png"> -
          this pointer is used to select a cell (with a single click) or
          activate it for editing (with a double-click).</p>
        <p>If you hover over the thick line around a highlighted cell (anywhere
          but the fill handle) the pointer changes to this: <img alt="Cell border"
            src="pointer_type_cell_border.png"> - this pointer can be used to
          move a cell, including its contents, to another location. If you
          click, hold, and drag with the left mouse button on the edge of a cell
          or a range of cells they will be moved to the location where you
          release the button.</p>
        <p>Last for now, if you hover over the fill handle the pointer looks
          like this: <img alt="Fill" src="pointer_type_fill.png"> - with this
          pointer, if you click/hold/drag the fill handle you can either copy
          the contents, or create a series into the cells you drag over.</p>

      <p><input name="checkbox3" type="checkbox">3. <strong>Filtering by
          numeric values</strong>. Switch back to the full data set in Sheet
        1.&nbsp; Next we will filter petiole diameter to only show diameters
        bigger than 3. If you drop down the filter menu for petiole diameter,
        you'll see that you get a list of unique numbers in the column, sorted
        in numeric order. You could un-select all of them that are less than 3,
        but as the data set gets large and the number of different values
        increases this approach becomes too time consuming.</p>
      <p>Instead, select "Number filters" â†’ "Greater than or equal to", and
        enter 3 for the value. Since the leaf type filter is still in place, you
        are now seeing the T leaves with petiole diameters greater than or equal
        to 3.</p>
      <p>Copy the data, make a new sheet (Sheet3), and paste the data there.</p>
      <p>Switch back to Sheet1, and clear the filters selectively from
        petiole.diameter by selecting "Clear filter from petiole.diameter" from
        the drop-down menu.</p>
      <p>Turn off filtering by selecting "Sort &amp; Filter" and clicking on
        "Filter" again - this is a toggle, meaning that selecting it when it's
        off turns filtering on, and selecting when it's on turns filtering off.
        With filtering turned off all the data are displayed, in the original
        order.</p>
      <h3 id="fill-handle" class="part">B. Proper use of the "fill handle" and
        the "fill" menu.</h3>
      <p>Now we are going to sequentially number the leaves in each group, which
        will help us when we re-organize the data in the next step.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox4" type="checkbox">4. <strong>Sort by type</strong>.
        We want to sort by leaf type so that we can easily number the leaves
        within each group. But before we do this you should know that...</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> SORTING A SPREADSHEET IS DANGEROUS</span></p>
        <p>Another problem with Excel's flexibility in data entry is that you
          have the ability to make big, costly mistakes with little or no
          effort.</p>
        <p>One of the quickest ways to irretrievably screw up your entire data
          set in Excel is to sort it incorrectly. For example, rows represent
          measurements from a single leaf, and if you sorted the leaf
          thicknesses without sorting the rest of the columns, you would
          scramble the data. If you didn't realize you did this, saved your
          work, and closed Excel, all "undo" information is lost and you would
          be unable to recover the original sort order. Worse yet, mistakes like
          this can be very difficult to detect - it doesn't change the data
          values, just the relationships between the variables - so you may
          never realize your data are all wrong.</p>
        <p>Excel knows this is a danger, and tries to help you - if you select
          part of a contiguous set of data and try to sort it, Excel will pop up
          a warning and ask if you want to extend the selection to include all
          of the contiguous data. You can take advantage of this to speed up
          your work - if you select just a single cell in a contiguous block,
          Excel assumes you want to sort the entire contiguous data set and will
          select it for you.</p>
        <p>So, to avoid problems, make sure your data are contiguous - that is,
          no blank columns. The data we are working with is contiguous, so we
          won't have a problem, but you've been warned!</p>
        <p>The other sort problem we have to be careful about is that unless we
          have a column that indicates the original sort order we won't be able
          to get back to the original order after we save and quit. Sometimes
          the original order of the data is important - the data may have been
          collected over time, for example, and it may be important to know the
          order that the data were observed. We will start by adding an
          "original order" column that shows how the data were sorted when we
          opened the worksheet - no matter how we sort the data, we can always
          get it back to the original sort order by sorting on this column.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><input name="checkbox5" type="checkbox">5. <strong>Make an "original
          order" column for safety, using the fill handle</strong>. Enter
        "Original order" in column H1.</p>
      <p>In cell H2 enter a 1. After you hit ENTER you will be in cell H3, so
        select H2 again. </p>
      <p>The little black box in the lower right is called the "fill
        handle",&nbsp;<img alt="Fill handle" src="fill_handle.png"> , and it
        does different things in different contexts. If you left-click, hold,
        and drag the handle down it acts as a copy/paste (go ahead and try this
        - fill down a few cells and you'll see you have 1's in each cell you
        filled into).</p>
      <p>Now, change the number in H3 to 2. Select both cells H2 and H3,<img alt="Extend"
          src="extend_series.png">. If you now double-click on the fill handle
        you will see that you now have sequential numbers from 1 to 103 in
        column H, indicating the current (original) sort order. Excel
        interpreted the two cells you selected as the start of a numerical
        sequence and it extended the sequence to the last row of data in the
        adjacent column G.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox6" type="checkbox">6. <strong>Sort by leaf type</strong>.
        To sort by type, just select cell G1, drop down "Sort &amp; Filter", and
        select "Sort A to Z" (that is, alphabetically, or in increasing numeric
        order). If you watch as this happens, you'll see that Excel very quickly
        expands the selection to the entire data set, and sorts the entire data
        set by leaf type - the rows are all intact, they are just ordered by
        type.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox7" type="checkbox">7. <strong>Enter sequential
          leaf numbers, using "fill series"</strong>. Enter the column heading
        "leaf.number" into cell I1.</p>
      <p>We could use the same trick as we used before, but sometimes it's
        inconvenient to use the fill handle (if there are thousands of rows, for
        example). In this case we want to be able to number the leaves
        sequentially for each group from 1 to n, where n is the number of leaves
        in a group. We can create sequential numbering for a whole set of
        selected rows, which will work better for this task.</p>
      <p>Enter a 1 in cell I2, and then select all the cells from I2 to I53
        (which are the rows that have G leaves).</p>
      <p>Next, select "Fill" â†’ "Series" from the ribbon - it's just to the left
        of Sort&amp;Filter and it's labeled "Fill" if you have Excel at full
        screen. If not, it will look like this: <img alt="Fill series" src="fill_series.png">.
      </p>
      <p>In the window that pops up, the default settings of a "Linear" type,
        with a "Step value" of 1 will give us sequential numbers, so click "OK".</p>
      <p>Repeat this for T leaves (enter a 1 in cell I54, and fill the series to
        the last row).</p>
      <p><input name="box8a" type="checkbox">8. Sort the columns from left to

          then click on "Sort &amp; Filter" â†’ "Custom sort". In the dialog that
          pops up, you'll see that you can select a "Sort by" column, and then
          can "Sort On" either the data values in the cells (the default), or by
          formatting information. Excel's default assumption is that you want to
          sort rows, so these options are all selected to allow you to pick
          column labels. We don't want to sort rows this time, so ignore all
          these settings for the moment.</li>
        <li>Click on "Options" and select "Sort left to right", and then "OK".</li>

          <li>Select "Row 1" for the "Sort by" selection, and leave the rest at

      <h3 id="pivotTable" class="part">C. Using Pivot Tables to summarize your
        data.</h3>
      <p>Excel's PivotTable is a tool for summarizing stacked data sets. Once
        you learn how they work, you'll see that PivotTables are an easy,
        convenient way to summarize complex data sets.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox8" type="checkbox">9. <strong>Construct a Pivot
          Table</strong>. We will use Pivot Tables today to calculate the sample
        size, average, and standard deviation of mass for each leaf type.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox9" type="checkbox">a. Make sure you're in Sheet1,
        and select any cell in the block of data, activate the "Insert" tab, and
        click on PivotTable ( <a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_table1.jpeg">like
          this</a><span class="ipt">like this<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table1.jpeg"></span></span>).</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox10" type="checkbox">b. You will see the Create
        PivotTable dialog <a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_table2.jpeg">pop
          up</a><span class="ipt">pop up<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table2.jpeg"></span></span>,
        and you will see that it has successfully found your data and identified
        it in "Table/Range:". The format of this entry is Sheet1!$A$1:$I$104.
        This is saying that the data are in Sheet 1, with the upper left cell
        found in cell A1, and the lower right cell found in I104. We will learn
        about the meaning of the dollar signs later this semester, but for now
        ignore them - they don't change the fact that the cell references are A1
        and I104. If you look at the data still visible behind the Create Pivot
        Table window, there is a dotted line around the data that indicates what
        the Pivot Table will be using.</p>
      <p>Having found the data you wish to summarize, you now need to decide
        where to put the summary table - by default Excel elects to <strong>create
          a new worksheet</strong>, which is what you want here. Select "OK" to
        create the table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox11" type="checkbox">c. Now you can construct the
        table. You should be looking at a new worksheet (Sheet4), with a <a class="link"
          style="display: none" href="pivot_table3.jpeg">blank template</a><span
          class="ipt">blank template<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table3.jpeg"></span></span>
        for your table to the left, a list of the column names in your data
        range to the <a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_table4.jpeg">upper
          right</a><span class="ipt">upper right<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table4.jpeg"></span></span>,
        and a set of possible places to place the variables in the table in the
        <a class="link" style="display: none" href="pivot_table5.jpeg">lower
          right</a><span class="ipt">lower right<span class="ip"><img src="pivot_table5.jpeg"></span></span>.</p>
      <p> The simplest way to construct the table is to drag the names of the
        variables you wish to use from the Field List into the blank template -
        in computer science a "field" is a column in a table, so the PivotTable
        Fields list is a listing of all the columns in your data set. The
        variable "<strong>type</strong>" is your grouping variable, so drag it
        from the field list and drop it into the "<strong>Drop Column Fields
          Here</strong>" bar in the template. You will see that the two leaf
        types present in the data are now showing as column labels (T and G). </p>
      <p>You wish to calculate mean and standard deviation of mass, so select "<strong>mass</strong>"
        and drag it to the "<strong>Drop Value Fields Here</strong>" area. You
        will now have summarized data, and by default Excel picks a sum as the
        statistic to report for numeric data. It looks like this:</p>
      <img alt="Sums" src="first_pivot_table_sum.png">
      <p>The layout is fine, but the statistic is wrong, so double-click on "Sum
        of mass" in the table and change "Sum" to "Average". It will now look
        like this:</p>
      <img alt="Averages" src="first_pivot_table_average.png">
      <p>You'll see a funny quirk of Excel pivot tables at this point - the row
        and column labels still say "Total" and "Grand Total" respectively.
        These are not totals (which imply a sum), they are averages, but Excel
        doesn't change the labeling when the summary statistic changes.</p>
      <p>Now we will add a standard deviation. Once again drag "mass" from the
        list of fields over to the pivot table, and drop it on top of the
        averages of mass. You will see that Sum of mass is now sitting next to
        Average of mass beneath each leaf type label. Double-click "Sum of mass"
        and change "Sum" to "StdDev" (not StdDevp, which is the population
        standard deviation - you will probably never use this option, as you
        will always be dealing with samples of data).</p>
      <p>When you dropped mass into the value fields for the second time, you
        may have noticed that the "Column Labels" block gained an item called Î£
        Values. You can drag this box between the columns and rows blocks to
        change the layout - when it's in the ROWS block each statistic is in a
        different row, and if you drag it to the COLUMNS each statistic is in a
        separate column beneath its corresponding leaf type. With the leaf types
        acting as column groupings the table is much easier to read if you put
        the statistics in rows - make sure Î£ Values is in the ROWS box.</p>
      <p>You can also build and rearrange the pivot table using the "Drag fields
        between areas below:" boxes, at the bottom of the "PivotTable Fields"
        list - this time, drag "mass" from the field list into the "Î£ Values"
        area where Average of mass and StDev of mass currently reside. You will
        now see a "Sum of mass" again, below the standard deviations. </p>
      <p>Change this third mass entry to be a count by clicking on "Sum of mass"
        in "Î£ Values", and selecting "Value field settings" from the drop-down
        menu. You will be taken to the "Value Field Settings" window again, and
        there you can change the summary statistic to a count - this gives you
        your sample size.</p>
      <p>At this point, you should have a table with a column called Data that
        gives average, stdev, and count of mass as labels, a column with G as
        the type, a column with T as the type, and a column called Grand Total
        that gives the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for all leaves.</p>
      <input name="checkbox12" type="checkbox">10. <strong>Change the
        arrangement of the table</strong>. We would like to swap the row and
      column labels next - that is, we want the Types to be row labels, and to
      have a different summary statistic in each column. There are two different
      ways to do this.<br>
      <p><input name="checkbox13" type="checkbox"> a. Method 1 - you can use
        Paste Special to transpose the table. Select the table from the upper
        left to the lower right edges (from cell A3 to cell D7), position your
        pointer someplace over the selected cells, and right-click. From the
        menu that pops up select "Copy". Select cell A14, right-click and select
        "Paste special" â†’ "Paste special" (the second one is at the very bottom
        of the popup menu). You will get a <a class="link" style="display: none"
          href="paste_special.jpeg">Paste Special dialog</a><span class="ipt">Paste
          Special dialog<span class="ip"><img src="paste_special.jpeg"></span></span>
        that allows you to do several possible things with the data you selected
        when you paste it. From the "Paste" area, change from "All" to "Values";
        this will just paste the numbers and letters, but will omit formatting
        and any cell formulas that may mess up the resulting table. Finally,
        click on "Transpose" (which is in the lower-right of the dialog), which
        means to swap the rows and columns. Click "OK". You'll see that your
        table has the same data values as before, but now the types are row
        labels, and the summary labels are in the columns.</p>
      <p>This method works fine, but the pasted cells are no longer a pivot
        table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox14" type="checkbox">b. Method 2 - you can
        re-arrange the pivot table structure. Select a cell inside the table to
        activate the PivotTable editing tools again. Now, in the lower right
        boxes you can drag "type" from column labels to row labels. The
        resulting table may have all the summaries stacked on top of each other
        - if so, fix this by dragging the "Î£ Values" row label into the Column
        Labels area. This should give you the table you want, with types as row
        labels and summary types as column labels.</p>
      <p>We won't be using the "Filters" option today, but it does what you
        might expect from our filtering exercise, above - if you were to drop
        the leaf type variable into the "Filters" area, you could use that to
        show just one leaf type or the other in the pivot table.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox20" type="checkbox">11. <strong>Un-stack the data</strong>.
        The reason we sequentially numbered the leaves in Sheet1 was to make it
        easy to un-stack one of the columns of data into a column for each leaf
        type using a Pivot Table. Although I want you to use stacked data
        whenever possible, there are times that you might need the data in an
        un-stacked arrangement (there are some statistical tests in MINITAB that
        require un-stacked data, for example).</p>
      <p>To un-stack a column, switch back to Sheet1 and insert a new Pivot
        Table (make a new one instead of changing the one you've already made,
        we're not done with it yet), and then use leaf.number as the Rows, and
        type as the Columns. We now just need to put whatever variable we want
        to un-stack into Values - drag mass into the Values, and you will see a
        column for G leaves and a column for T leaves of masses. Excel tells you
        it is using the "Sum of mass", but since each row is a unique leaf
        number the sums are actually just data values.</p>
      <h3 class="part" id="blanksZeros">Blanks and zeros</h3>
      <p>Spreadsheets make a distinction between missing values and measured
        zeros. A measured zero is an actual data value that was observed to be
        equal to zero. A missing value is a data point with an unknown value
        (because it was never measured, equipment failed, a computer crashed, or
        whatever), and shouldn't be assumed to be zero (or any other number, for
        that matter).</p>
      <p>We can see how Excel makes a distinction between the two very easily,
        because all of the formulas and the pivot table itself are all linked to
        the leaf data set. If we change a data value, we just need to update the
        pivot table and the calculated values will update as well.</p>
      <p><input name="checkbox22" type="checkbox">12. <strong>Change a data
          value to zero, and update the pivot table</strong>. We will now change
        a data value in Sheet1 to a 0 and see what it does to the summary
        statistics in the PivotTable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the data in Sheet1. </li>
        <li>Sort on the original order to get the data back to its original sort
          order.</li>
        <li>Change the mass in the first row&nbsp;from 4 to 0.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Switch to the pivot table we use to calculate means, standard
          deviations, and sample sizes for mass. Right-click a cell within the
          table, and select "Refresh", and as you do so watch how the numbers in
          the table change. Since you changed one of the tree leaf masses to 0
          the average and standard deviation for leaf should change. Sample size
          doesn't change, however, because the 0 is considered a measured value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><input name="checkbox23" type="checkbox">13. <strong>Delete a data
          value and update the pivot table</strong>. Now we will see how things
        change when we delete the data value in Sheet1 instead of setting it to
        0.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the data in Sheet1 and delete the 0 you entered (use
          either backspace or delete - these are not the same in Excel, but
          either will work here). </li>
        <li>Now, back to the pivot table, and refresh again. Since a data value
          is missing, the average, standard deviation, and the sample size all
          change. The average should change less than when the value was set to
          0, because the 0 mass dragged the average down.</li>
      </ul>
