      <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Crimson Text&quot;,serif;"></span>Welcome
        to Biol 531! This class will teach you to use general linear models to
        analyze data sets that are typically encountered in the biological
        sciences. General linear models (or GLMs for short) encompass everything
        from complex ANOVA designs and multiple regression, which use either
        categorical or numeric predictors, respectively, as well as mixes of the
        two.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for us, this subject is best learned by doing, and if you
        have a computer capable of reading these instructions you should be able
        to run the software you will need to complete classwork. When I've
        taught this class in the past, in a classroom with students present (if
        you remember those days) I relied on CougarApps to deliver the software
        we needed - some students installed the software at home, but it wasn't
        necessary to do so. Now, with all of us working at home, there are some
        disadvantages of running the software through CougarApps, and in the
        long run you will be much better off installing the software at home. We
        will devote this session to installing the two packages you will need, R
        and R Studio, learning a little about what they are and how they work,
        and then using them to review t-tests.</p>
      <h2>Please read the whole thing</h2>
      <p>As I mentioned in the syllabus and the introduction to the class, this
        is a graduate level class, and is thus intended for people who need to
        learn statistics for their careers in biology. I put a lot of effort
        into writing these instructions because I think you need to know this
        stuff to be effective in a career as a biologist - if after a long
        career in the biological sciences you find that you didn't need to know
        something I asked you to read, you can email me (or message me with
        whatever method is in use in the year 2060, telepathy maybe) and if I'm
        still alive I'll apologize for wasting your time. For now, give me the
        benefit of the doubt that this is all important, and try to learn the
        material by reading what I wrote for you. Also, since I won't be able to
        answer your questions in real time while you're working on your own at
        home, if the only questions you need to ask me are the ones that aren't
        already answered in these instructions you'll make much better progress,
        and be much less frustrated.</p>
      <h2>A little background on R</h2>
      <p>The statistical package we are using for this class, called "R", is
        free of charge. The reason that it is free is interesting, and before we
        move on to the installation, you should know a little about the
        software.</p>
      <p>R is an "open source" implementation of the S+ statistical computing
        language, and is available for several different computing platforms
        (Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems). Open
        source software is developed in a collaborative way by teams of
        programmers, often on a volunteer basis. There are many reasons that
        programmers choose to participate in open source projects (some are
        paid, some do it for personal satisfaction, etc.), but from a user's
        perspective there are several practical advantages to using open source
        software, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "source code" written by the programmers can be reviewed by
          other programmers, or even by users if they know how, which provides a
          form of peer review for the code. Peer review is an important quality
          control mechanism in scientific work, and it has the same benefits in
          software development. </li>
        <li>Openness in the development process promotes a cooperative attitude
          in the users, which can lead to a tremendous amount of contributed
          code; the benefit of this becomes obvious both through R's impressive
          feature set, as well the huge number of contributed extensions that
          allow R to perform some very specialized types of data analysis. You
          can see the list of available add-on packages <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">here</a>,
          grouped by the type of problem the add-on is useful for addressing.
          You will find contributed packages that do anything from estimating
          home range sizes from animal point locations, to analysis of genomics
          experiments. As of this writing there are over 10,000 contributed
          packages available, and it is likely that whatever analysis task you
          encounter there will be at least one package that can perform the
          analysis you need.</li>
        <li>Open source software generally embraces open standards, including
          open file formats. Because of this, you will not have your data locked
          in a file format that can only be opened if you continue to license a
          particular software package. For example, if you entered all your data
          into a system that CSUSM licensed (we'll call it DataAnalytica), and
          then they let the license lapse because it was too expensive, you may
          not be able to open your own data files again unless you paid for a
          licensed copy of DataAnalytica yourself. With open data file formats
          any software developer can write an import program that can open the
          file, so you would be free to move to another software platform
          without losing your data.</li>
        <li>Because the code is contributed for free, open source software is
          usually distributed free of charge, which is true of R.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>R is a flexible, comprehensive platform for statistical analysis and
        graphics. It is extremely powerful, but by itself it is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span>
        user friendly (for beginners I would go so far as to say that it's user
        hostile). To make it friendlier and more efficient to use, we will do
        all of our work in R through a program called R Studio.</p>
      <h2 id="rstudio" class="part">A kinder, gentler interface</h2>
      <p>If you were to download, install, and run R by itself you would see a
        program that looks like <a href="rgui.png">this</a> (on Windows, and it
        would be similar on a Mac, and even more rudimentary in Linux). The "R
        Console" is where commands are issued, and the graphical user interface
        (or GUI) that is distributed is very rudimentary - there are no menus
        for running statistical analyses or making graphs like you get with
        MINITAB, and all of the menu selections and buttons are for opening and
        saving R's "workspaces", printing output, or managing add-on packages.
        There are also some fairly simple things (like having more than one
        graph displayed on the screen at the same time) that are difficult to
        do.</p>
      <p>There are GUI's that have been developed that use R for all of their
        calculations, but provide a menu-based interface, much like MINITAB. We
        won't be using these, because they are limiting - particularly later in
        the semester when we learn about model-based inference we will make good
        use of the command line interface of R to run multiple analyses that
        have only slightly different code, and which is much more efficient with
        written commands than with a menu-based GUI. If you're going to use R,
        it's good to learn to write R code.</p>
      <p>Between the extremes of using a full-blown graphical interface vs.
        running everything directly in R, there are are "integrated development
        environments" (or IDEs) designed to help us use R more efficiently and
        easily. There are several IDEs available, but in my opinion the best is
        R Studio. R Studio does not provide a graphical interface to R's
        statistical analysis, but it is a graphical interface to such useful
        things as accessing help files, browsing for and importing data files,
        managing graphs, and editing R commands. It also helps organize your
        work, and provides a very nice system for documenting your analysis. It
        is the tool I use in my own work, and it is well worth the effort to
        learn.</p>
      <h2>Getting started - install the software you need</h2>
      <p>The best way to use R and R Studio is to install them on your own
        computer. It isn't hard to get them installed, and both run on Windows,
        Mac OS, or Linux. If you can't install them on your own computer for
        some reason, it is possible to run both through Cougar Apps, but I
        recommend against relying on this - it will be more likely to crash, and
        there is an annoying bug that only crops up when you run R Studio via
        Cougar Apps that will make it harder for you to produce the Word
        documents you'll turn in for your assignments. If there is some reason
        you cannot install R and R Studio on your own computer please let me
        know, and I will post a separate lesson on running the software through
        Cougar Apps for you.</p>
      <p>To get up and running, you will need to first install the most recent
        version of R, then install the most recent version of R Studio. </p>
      <p>First, install R:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the R installer for <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Windows</a>,
          or for the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac OS</a>
          (if you're a Linux user, like I am, congratulations! Let me know and
          I'll help you with your installation, it's a snap. Most recent
          Chromebooks can run Linux apps, so if you're using a Chromebook we can
          probably get the Linux version installed on your computer too)</li>
        <li>Install R as you would any other program on your platform - launch
          the installer, and follow the directions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next, you will want to install R Studio:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the Free version of R Studio Desktop for your OS <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a></li>
        <li>Launch the installer and follow the instructions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should now be able to start R Studio (you will see that R is
        installed and can be run on its own, but we will never have need to do
        that in this class - you will always use R via R Studio).</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Starting R Studio for the first time</h3>
      <p>Now we can launch R Studio for the first time. Note that some of the
        functionality we will need for class is provided by external packages,
        called <strong>libraries</strong> in R, that are not part of the base
        package. If the first time you launch R Studio you are asked if you want
        to install some additional libraries it says it needs, say yes. This
        will happen occasionally as you work through the activities, but should
        only happen the first time you use a new feature of the software - once
        the libraries needed are installed they shouldn't need to be
        re-installed for the rest of the semester.</p>
      <p>When you run R Studio, you will see a window that looks like this:</p>
      <div id="rstudio_map"> <a href="#" id="console" class="tooltip"><span>Console</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="fileMenu" class="tooltip"><span>Menu bar (File menu)</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="projectMenu" class="tooltip"><span>Project menu</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="environmentTab" class="tooltip"><span>Environment tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="historyTab" class="tooltip"><span>History tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="filesTab" class="tooltip"><span>Files tab</span></a> <a
          href="#" id="plotsTab" class="tooltip"><span>Plots tab</span></a> <a
          href="#" id="packagesTab" class="tooltip"><span>Packages tab</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="helpTab" class="tooltip"><span>Help tab</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear: both">If you move your mouse over the picture above
        you'll see popups that indicate the location of the: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Console - where R commands are entered, and output is displayed</li>
        <li>Menu bar - where the File menu is found (and other menus that we
          will learn about as needed) </li>
        <li>The Project menu - where projects can be created, opened, or closed</li>
        <li>Environment tab - where all the objects in our workspace will be
          displayed. The environment is active working space, in computer
          memory.</li>
        <li>History tab - a list of the commands used, which can be selected and
          re-used</li>
        <li>Files tab - where the files in the current working directory are
          displayed. These are files stored on disk, rather than being loaded in
          computer memory. We would need to load a data file from disk into
          memory for it to appear in the Environment, and to be usable by R.
          Note that the contents of your Files tab will be different, because it
          will reflect the files on your own computer.</li>
        <li>Plots tab - where any graphs we make will be viewed (and from where
          they can be copied for pasting, or exported to a file)</li>
        <li>Packages tab - where add-on packages that are currently installed
          are listed, and can be loaded for use</li>
        <li>Help tab - where help files can be searched and viewed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will learn what to do with each of these throughout the course of
        the semester.</p>
      <p>A quick note about the Help files.. you may not find them all that
        helpful. One of the downsides of using an open source package is that
        the help files are not always very beginner friendly, because they are
        written by the developers who are expert statisticians as well as
        experts in R, and they assume you are also an expert statistician who
        knows R and only need to know how to make the command work. The
        explanations are at a much higher level of sophistication than you need
        right now, and even the explanations of how the commands work use terms
        that you may not know yet. As you learn more about how R works you may
        be able to use them, but initially they will probably just confuse you
        (I've found this to be true about the statistical material in Wikipedia
        as well, by the way - it's written at a much higher level of
        sophistication than is needed by beginners. This seems to be a problem
        with material contributed by volunteers - the people who contribute are
        experts in the subject, but not experts on the needs of beginners).
        Consider me, and the materials I provide you, to be your Help file for
        now.</p>
      <h2 id="projects" class="part">Start a new project</h2>
      <p>One of the best features of R Studio is that it helps organize your
        work, using <strong>projects</strong>. Projects are a folder that
        contains all of the files needed for the analysis task you are
        completing, including the data sets and commands you used. You will want
        to get into the habit of starting each assignment with a new project, so
        that you don't end up with a confusing mess of hundreds of files that
        pertain to all the different analyses we do throughout the semester. </p>
      <p>To make a new R Studio project, do the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "File" â†’ "New Project..."</li>
        <li>In the "Create Project" window, select "New Directory".</li>
        <li>In the "Project Type" window select "New Project".</li>
        <li>In the "Create New Project" window we will name the new directory
          (folder) for this project, as well as specify which directory it will
          be under:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter "review1" as the directory name - this will be the folder
            that's just for this activity. </li>
          <li>Under "Create project as subdirectory of", click "Browse" and
            navigate to the location you want to keep Biol 531 class material in
            (don't use the Trash, that's not funny) - generally, you will either
            want to use your Documents folder, or your Desktop. Once you've
            gotten to the right place, make a new folder called "Biol531" and
            select it.</li>
          <li>Back at the "Create New Project" settings window, confirm that you
            have review1 in "Directory name", and your Biol531 folder in the
            "Create project as subdirectory of" field, and then click "Create
            Project" to create the new project.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you're done you'll see that the Environment tab is blank, except
        for a gray "Environment is empty" label, and the "Files" tab shows a
        review1.Rproj file, which is the new <strong>project file</strong> that
        R Studio just created. Project files don't contain data sets or a
        history of the commands you've used, those will be in files called
        .RData and .Rhistory respectively, but the project file does record
        things like the window states - if you have a data set open for viewing
        when you close the project, it will be open when you start up R Studio
        again with this project file. The .RData and .Rhistory files will be
        created the first time you save, but you won't have them in your Files
        tab yet.</p>
      <p>The thin status bar just above the "Name" label shows that you are
        looking at the contents of the new folder you just created. This is your
        <strong>working directory</strong>, which R will use for output files,
        and where it will look for any input files unless you tell it otherwise.
        By default, when you make a new project R sets the working directory to
        the project folder for you (it's possible to use something else, but if
        you are using projects to organize your work it's best to use the
        project folder as your working directory).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When I need to give you a little information that's FYI, but a bit
          off topic, I'll use block quotes like this one. For example, I've
          found that student are not always aware of the distinction between
          file names and filename extensions, so here's a little information
          about them.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Mac users may not be familiar with filename extensions (and some
          Windows users may not be used to seeing them if their systems are set
          to hide them by default). Computer files have a format that programs
          need to understand in order to properly read the file's contents, and
          there are different ways of letting programs know the format of a
          file. In the Mac world, the format of the file is recorded in the file
          itself, and when a program opens the file it reads its type from
          information embedded at the beginning of the file. In Windows it has
          been the convention to indicate the file's type using a <strong>filename
            extension</strong> - the filename extension is a (usually) three
          letters after a period at the end of the file name. For example,
          programs have a .exe extension, old binary versions of MS Excel files
          have a .xls extension, old binary versions of MS Word files have a
          .doc extension, and plain text files have a .txt extension. In more
          recent versions of Windows filename extensions can be longer than
          three characters, so the newer text-based Excel file format has a
          .xlsx extension, and the text-based Word format has a .docx extension.</p>
        <p>Although programs do not always rely exclusively on filename
          extensions to know what kind of file they are opening, R Studio does.
          An R Studio project file has to have a .Rproj extension or R Studio
          refuses to treat it as a project file. I believe this is the case in
          the Mac as well as in Windows, even though the Mac operating system
          doesn't require filename extensions...so, Mac users, don't delete the
          .Rproj extension from your project files.</p>
        <p>Another difference between the Mac and Windows is in the effect of
          using a period at the beginning of a filename - in Windows the period
          is just another character, and using a period at the beginning of a
          filename is no different than using any letter or number. The Mac uses
          the convention found in Unix operating systems (which the Mac OS is
          based on) of hiding files that have a period as the first character.
          Because of this difference, in Windows you will see the .RData file if
          you open your project in the Windows File Explorer, but on the Mac you
          will not see it unless you ask to show hidden files. R Studio shows
          hidden files in the Files tab by default, so you will see the .RData
          and .Rhistory files in the Files tab regardless of the OS you are
          using. </p>
        <p>What's the point of hiding a file in the first place? Hidden files
          are often used for settings, or for other things that the user isn't
          intended to interact with directly but that are necessary for the
          program to run, and hiding the file keeps users from accidentally
          corrupting or deleting something that is needed for the system to run.</p>
        <p>On both systems, once R Studio is installed, if you double-click on
          an .Rproj file it will start R Studio with that project open.</p>
        <p>By the way, if you have experience with other programming languages,
          bear in mind that periods in R commands aren't used to indicate object
          properties, they are just another character - I use them a lot to
          separate words in names, because spaces can't be used that way in R.
          In R the symbol that is used to designate properties of objects is the
          dollar sign (we'll see this in use shortly).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Try a couple of R commands in the Console</h3>
      <p>A good way to start learning R is to enter some simple commands in the
        Console. R commands are entered to the right of the bottom-most <strong>prompt</strong>,
        which is the blue greater-than symbol, &gt;. A simple R command is:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">5+5</p>
      <p>I'll use a font and color for commands that look like the Console to
        help you identify the commands you're meant to enter from these
        instructions - enter this command next to the prompt and hit ENTER, and
        you will see just below your command the output:</p>
      <p class="rout">[1] 10</p>
      <p>The 1 in square brackets is an index number - it just says that 10 is
        the first <strong>element</strong> of the output, and the value 10 is
        indeed 5+5.</p>
      <p>R is <strong>object-oriented</strong>, meaning that it is designed to
        work in a way that is similar to objects in the real world work. What I
        mean by this is easier to understand through a simple example.</p>
      <p>First, let's make a <strong>vector</strong> of numbers - a vector is
        just a set of elements that can be indexed with a single number. You
        make a vector in R with the c() function:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)</p>
      <p>If you hit Enter you will see output:</p>
      <p class="rout">[1] 2 4 6 8 10</p>
      <p><strong></strong> You still only see [1] as the index, because R only
        reports the index number at the beginning of the row of output, to keep
        the output compact. But, this is a vector with five elements - the first
        element has a value of 2, the second has a value of 4, and so on.</p>
      <p>The output of our command was reported to the console, but it wasn't
        saved into an object. To assign the output of this c() command to an
        object, use the up-arrow key on your keyboard (â†‘) to <strong>recall</strong>
        the command, and edit it to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">numbers &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)</p>
      <p>If you hit ENTER you won't see any output in the console this time, but
        you will now have an object in your Environment tab called numbers, and
        the contents of the object are displayed to the right of its name. The
        &lt;- (less than followed by a dash) together make a left-pointing
        arrow, which is called the <strong>assignment operator</strong> in R -
        it tells R to take the vector we're creating on the right side of the
        arrow and assign it to the object with the name numbers on the left. You
        can use a right-pointing arrow instead; we could have used:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) -&gt; numbers</p>
      <p>to accomplish the same thing.</p>
      <p>The Environment tab gives you a brief preview of what the numbers
        object contains, and since numbers is a short vector of only five
        elements you can see all of it. Another way to see the contents of an
        object is to display it in the console by entering its name - if you
        type:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">numbers</p>
      <p>and hit ENTER the five numbers this object contains are displayed in
        the console.</p>
      <p>You can use objects in other commands by typing their names - for
        example, if you want to add 10 to each number you would use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">10 + numbers</p>
      <p>to get:</p>
      <p class="rout">[1] 12 14 16 18 20</p>
      <p>You can see that this command added the number we specified (10) to
        each element in the numbers vector. Since we didn't assign this output
        to an object it is reported to the Console, but it isn't saved anywhere.</p>
      <p>Most of the time we will be using R functions rather than typing in the
        formulas for doing calculations. Functions are commands that have a name
        followed by parentheses (with no space between the name and the left
        parenthesis), with arguments within the parentheses that provide the
        function with instructions about how to work, or with data to work on.
        We have already used one function, the c() function, which creates a
        vector out of the arguments within the parentheses. For our second
        function, we can use summary() on our numbers object to summarize its
        contents:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summary(numbers)</p>
      <p>which gives us this output:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp; Min. 1st Qu.&nbsp; Median&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Mean 3rd Qu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        10&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may recognize this from your introductory statistics class as the
        five number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile,
        maximum), along with the mean of the data - this is a useful way to
        summarize numeric data, and you can use it to see if the data are skewed
        (if the data are skewed the median and mean will not be the same, and
        the spacing between the median and the quartiles or the maximum and
        minimum will not be equal).</p>
      <p>One of the defining characteristics of an object-oriented language like
        R is that the same command applied to different kinds of objects gives
        you different results, just like real objects in the real world. For
        example, if I asked you to summarize a set of data you would give me a
        set of summary statistics, but if I asked you to summarize a movie you
        would tell me about the plot - thus, even though the command you
        received was the same, the <strong>method</strong> you used would be
        selected to match what you were summarizing. Likewise, in R the same
        summary() function will give different results if we apply it to a
        vector of text, instead of a vector of numbers. To demonstrate this,
        make a vector of words called text, like so:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">text &lt;- c("blue","green","red","yellow","orange")</p>
      <p>You will see that you now have a second object in your Environment
        called text, but its type is shown as "chr" (for "character") instead of
        "num" (for "numeric"), and its elements are the five colors you entered.
        The words are all enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes
        would have worked, as long as they match) to indicate that these are
        text labels rather than names of objects.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> What happens if you type a word without quotes? R assumes a word
          without quotes is supposed to be an object name, and gives you an
          error message when it can't find that object in your Environment. For
          example, if you had entered:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">c(blue, green, red, yellow, orange)</p>
        <p>you would get the message:</p>
        <p class="rerror">Error: object 'blue' not found</p>
        <p>Because the word blue isn't quoted, R assumed it to be an object
          name, looked for the object called blue in your environment, and gave
          you an error when it couldn't find it (this was a fatal error, meaning
          that the function couldn't proceed to the next argument after
          encountering it, so it hasn't looked for green, red, yellow, or orange
          yet, but they too would have caused the same problem). </p>
        <p>Get to know this error, by the way, you'll be seeing it a lot... the
          other very common way to get it is to misspell an object name, or to
          use the wrong case (lowercase when you should have used uppercase, or
          the reverse) in your command. Embrace it, it will be your companion
          (I've been using R for 20 years, and I still get plenty of them) -
          when you see it, start looking for typos.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>R objects have <strong>methods</strong>, which are instructions for
        what to do when a command is applied to them. If you use the same
        summary() command on the text object that we used on the numbers object:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">summary(text)</p>
      <p>you will get output:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp; Length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mode <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 character character&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This output is different, because the summary method for a vector of
        text is different than for a vector of numbers. It wouldn't make sense
        to try to calculate the mean of five words, so R doesn't do that -
        instead, it tells us this vector has five elements in it (length of 5),
        and has a Class and Mode of character (don't worry about the difference
        between Class and Mode, it's not important to us at this point, but both
        are indicating this vector is a bunch of character data rather than
        numbers). This means that the same function can be used on objects of
        different type to get output that is appropriate for that object type.</p>
      <blockquote class="rout">
        <p> A quick note about object types - if we had entered:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">c("2","4","6","8","10")</p>
        <p>then the output would have shown us the numbers with quotes:</p>
        <p class="rout">[1] "2"&nbsp; "4"&nbsp; "6"&nbsp; "8"&nbsp; "10"</p>
        <p>indicating that they are being treated as text labels, rather than as
          numbers. If we summarized this vector of numbers as text, we would
          get:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">summary(c("2","4","6","8","10"))</p>
        <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp; Length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mode <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 character character </p>
        <p>So, entering the numbers quoted makes R treat them like text, and
          changes how they are summarized. </p>
        <p>Also, notice that we didn't need to make an object of the quoted
          numbers before summarizing them - we could use the c() command as an
          argument for the summary() command instead. When R sees this, it works
          on the functions from the inside out - it evaluates the c() function
          by making a vector of quoted numbers, then passes the text vector
          created by c() to the summary() function, which summarizes the output.</p>
        <p>Nesting commands is something we will do periodically, but I think it
          makes code more difficult to understand, and is less
          beginner-friendly, so we will use it sparingly (in this case, we could
          have assigned text-mode numbers to an object and then applied the
          summary command to that object, which makes it clearer what each part
          of the command is doing). If you do use nested functions, watch those
          parentheses - you need a close parentheses for every open one, and if
          you forget to close a parenthesis things get very confusing (R thinks
          you're making a multi-line command when you hit ENTER and changes the
          prompt to a + and awaits the rest of the command).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You can refer to the elements of an object by <strong>index number</strong>
        using square brackets at the end of the object name - for example, to
        see the fourth word stored in text you would use:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">text[4]</p>
      <p>will show you the fourth element in the text object, which is the word
        "yellow".</p>
      <p>We have been working in the Console so far, but that's not how we will
        be completing most of our work in here. Time to move on to the
        assignment for today. </p>
      <h2>Add an R Markdown file template to your project </h2>
      <p>We will be using a file format called <strong>R Markdown</strong> for
        all of our work in this class. R Markdown is a formatting language that
        allows us to use symbols to indicate how an output file created from the
        inputs we write will look. Markdown is a actually a pun, in that it is
        meant to be a simplified version of a markup language (such as HTML,
        short for hypertext markup language, which is used to format web pages
        like this one). But, in addition to formatting instructions, R's
        markdown format allows us to mix R commands into our document, which are
        executed when an output file is created.</p>
      <p>There are several major advantages to using R Markdown that make it
        useful not only for teaching and learning R, but as the platform for
        your own data analysis outside of class:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>R Markdown allows you to mix descriptive text and notes about why
          each step is being conducted in with the actual R code (the actual R
          code is entered in "code chunks" that are embedded in the document).
          This both helps you remember what you did, and explain it to others.</li>
        <li>R Markdown makes it possible to very easily repeat every step of the
          analysis if you discover that there was a mistake in a data file, or a
          mistake in an earlier command that affects later commands.</li>
        <li>A R Markdown document can easily be converted to another format,
          such as a web page, a PDF document, or an MS Word document, via a
          process R Studio calls <strong>knitting</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>R Studio's support for R Markdown is excellent, in that it makes the
        code chunks in a markdown file executable - you'll be able to enter code
        within the Rmd file, run it, and get output from it within R Studio,
        just like you would if you were working in the Console.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I will be providing you with templates of R markdown documents for
          each exercise - this week's file is <a href="review1.Rmd" title="Review 1 R markdown document">here</a>.
          The file is a simple text file, so when you click on the link your
          browser helpfully opens it in a new tab, because that's what browsers
          do with simple text files. But you don't want that, you want to
          download it, and you want to preserve the .Rmd file extension so that
          R Commander can use it properly.</p>
        <p>To download the file instead of opening it, right-click on the link
          (if you have a two button mouse) or CTRL+click the link (if you have a
          one-button mouse), and select "Save link as..." (or whatever version
          of this command your web browser provides). You will then be given a
          download window that lets you select the location to download the file
          - save it into your project directory (you'll see it in the Files tab
          of your project).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> Markdown files will have the filename extension .Rmd, so I'll refer to
        them as <strong>rmd files</strong> for short.</p>
      <p>Once the review1.Rmd file is in your project directory, click on its
        name in the "Files" tab to open it, and you should get a new tab open
        that shows you the contents of the file - it should look like this (you
        can hover over parts of the file to get popup notes about what each
        section is):</p>
      <div id="rmd_map"> <a href="#" id="rmdHeader" class="tooltip"><span>Header
            - only enter your name, no other changes</span></a> <a href="#" id="settingsChunk"
          class="tooltip"><span>Setup - don't touch, for R's use only</span></a>
        <a href="#" id="heading" class="tooltip"><span>A section heading - the
            ## are formatting characters</span></a> <a href="#" id="instructions"
          class="tooltip"><span>Instructions, background information from me to

          href="#" id="runButton" class="tooltip"><span>The run button - click
            to execute code in this chunk</span></a> </div>
      <p style="clear:both">You will find the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>File header - these instructions give the title of the document, the
          author (which will be you, change "Your Name Here" to your name in
          quotes), the date (which is R's date() function, which will time stamp
          the document when you knit it), and the output format that will be
          produced when the file is knitted (which will be an MS Word document
          file)</li>
        <li>Setup code chunk - this is a series of commands that tell R Studio
          how to create the output document. We won't be changing anything here,
          leave it alone and everything will be just fine</li>
        <li>A section heading - to help organize the instructions I will use
          sections, and section headings are indicated with ## symbols. This

        <li>Instructions, information about completing the assignment - black

        <li>Code chunk - code chunks are where you will enter your code and

          followed by curly brackets with the r keyword in them, {r}, and then
          with three more back-ticks on a line below to close the chunk. R
          Studio will render these in grey to make them easy to find.
          Additionally, I will name each code chunk to make them easier to refer
          to in the instructions (this one is onesample.import.data).</li>
        <li>A run button - at the right side at the top of the code chunk is a

      <p>A little further down in the file you'll see the first example of the

      <h3>Import the first data set from review_data.xls</h3>
      <p>We will be using data in <a href="review_data.xls">this file</a> for
        today's exercise. Download the file to your project folder (or, if your
        browser downloaded it someplace else by default, such as a Downloads
        folder or your desktop, move it into your project folder). You don't
        need to open it in Excel, but if you did you would find there are
        several worksheets in it, called (in order) onesample, twosample,
        paired, anova, and regression.</p>
      <p>Importing data from an Excel file is done by a contributed package,
        called a <strong>library</strong> by R, which needs to be loaded before
        the import command can be run. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The readxl library may not have been installed in your initial
          installation. You can check this by switching to the "Packages" tab
          and scrolling down the list - if readxl appears there you're all set,
          you can skip this installation step.</p>
        <p>If it's not there, you can install it by:</p>
        <p>- In the "Packages" tab click the "Install" button</p>
        <p>- In the "Install Packages" window that pops up, type readxl into the
          "Packages" field, and click "Install"</p>
        <p>Once the library is installed you can move on - you will only need to
          install it this first time.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To import the first worksheet from review_data.xls (which is in a sheet
        called "onesample" within the Excel file) you need two commands, one to
        load the library that contains the read_excel() function, and the
        read_excel() function that imports the data itself. To see how this
        works, in the <strong>console</strong> write: </p>
      <p class="rcmd">library(readxl)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">read_excel("review_data.xls", sheet = "onesample")</p>
      <p>The read_excel() function takes the name of the Excel data file as its
        first argument, and the name of the worksheet within it to import as its
        second argument.</p>
      <p>The output of this read_excel() function will look like this: </p>

      <p>A <strong>tibble</strong> is a dataset format that R uses in which
        variables are in columns, and data points are in rows. There are 25 data
        points and one variable (called Body.temperature, as the column name
        indicates) in this dataset, so it tells us this is a 25 x 1 tibble.</p>
      <p>Tibbles are a newer version of the standard R dataset format, called a
        <strong>data frame</strong>. Data frames are also datasets arranged in
        rows and columns, with each column representing a variable, but they
        lack a few features that tibbles provide. From our perspective data
        frames and tibbles are interchangeable, there are no features of tibbles
        that we require that data frames lack, so either one is fine. However,
        because tibbles are newer, not every R function has been rewritten to
        work with tibbles, and commands may fail for no apparent reason if we
        don't change the dataset to a data frame. So, modify the import command
        in your onesample.import.data code chunk to read:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">data.frame(read_excel("review_data.xls", sheet =
        "onesample"))</p>
      <p>The output is different, the entire data set is shown, with the first
        five rows of it shown here:</p>
      <p class="rout">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Body.temperature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>You can see that we're nesting the read_excel() function within a new
        function, data.frame(), which takes the tibble created by read_excel()
        and converts it to a data frame. Your onesample dataset will now be a
        data frame, and any of the commands we use in class will work with it.</p>
      <p>In R issuing commands without assigning the output to an object
        displays the results, but doesn't save them. To save the imported data
        into an object we will make an object called onesample and assign the
        imported data frame into it. To get this to happen when you complete
        your assignment and knit the document into its final form, you will need
        to add these commands to your <strong>Rmd file</strong>, in the
        onesample.import.data chunk:</p>
      <p class="rcmd"> library(readxl)</p>
      <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;- data.frame(read_excel("review_data.xls",
        sheet = "onesample"))</p>
      <p>If you run the code chunk (by hitting the green triangular Run button)
        it should execute successfully, with no errors, and you will be rewarded
        with a dataset called onesample in your environment, which is in the
        data frame format.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Before we move on, a quick aside about about arguments in
          functions...</p>
        <p>Note that the read_excel() function has two arguments, which are the
          name of the Excel file ("review_data.xls"), and the worksheet to be
          imported (sheet = "onesample"). Arguments are sometimes optional, and
          there are default values that R will use if you don't specify any. The
          read_excel() function has a lot of arguments - for example, if we want
          to tell the function to use the first row of each column as the column
          name in the R dataset, we could use the command:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;- read_excel("review_data.xls", sheet =
          "onesample", col_names = TRUE)</p>
        <p>But, the default is to use the first row of the worksheet as column
          names, so if we omit this argument we get column names anyway.</p>
        <p>Also, note that the sheet and col_names arguments are structured as
          argument_name = value (it's sheet = "onesample", and col_names = TRUE
          in this case), but the name of the data set doesn't have an argument
          name. There is a default order to the arguments, and if you don't use
          an argument name then the order of the arguments has to be correct.
          For example, the default is for the first argument to be the name of
          the file, and the second argument to be the name of the worksheet
          within the file to import, so this command will also work:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;-
          read_excel("review_data.xls","onesample")</p>
        <p> If we use argument names we can reverse the order and it will still
          work:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;- read_excel(sheet = "onesample", path =
          "review_data.xls")</p>
        <p>gives us the same result as the other two versions.</p>
        <p>But, if we reverse the order without argument names, we get an error:</p>
        <p class="rcmd">onesample &lt;- read_excel("onesample",
          "review_data.xls")</p>
        <p>gives us the error:</p>
        <p class="rerror">Error: `path` does not exist: â€˜onesampleâ€™</p>
        <p>The read_excel() function assumed that onesample was the name of the
          Excel file because it was the first argument with no argument names to
          tell it this was actually the worksheet name.</p>

      <p>At this point some of you clever students may have already realized
        that you can complete assignments quickly by just copying my commands
        and pasting them into R. The temptation to do this is great, but bear in
        mind that when you have to analyze data on your own (as you will have to
        on exams) this method won't be available, and R is fussy about command
        syntax. If you don't practice entering commands (and interpreting the
        often cryptic and unhelpful error messages R gives you when you make a
        mistake) you will have trouble on exams when you don't have pre-written
        commands to use. Take your time and practice typing commands now, it's
        good for you.</p>

      <p>For this exercise, we will test whether body temperature is different
        from 98.6 degrees. Imagine these data represent a set of body
        temperature measurements from a group of CSUSM statistics students.
        Because you have a single sample of data, with a single mean body
        temperature, you will compare the mean of the data to a hypothetical
        value you specify using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>1. Check the assumptions of the test. If you recall, a one-sample
        t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed. We can check this
        using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test - it assumes the data are normally
        distributed as the null hypothesis, so a p-value over 0.05 indicates
        normality. Enter the following in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>,
        in the onesample.normality code chunk:</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample$Body.temperature)</p>
      <p>The command is shapiro.test(), and it takes one argument, which is the
        variable that we want to test for normality. Note that we had to tell R
        both which data set to use, and which variable to use - if you tried
        shapiro.test(onesample) it would not work, even though there is only one
        variable, and if you tried shapiro.test(Body.temperature) it would not
        work because R wouldn't know which data set contained this variable,
        even though there is only one in the workspace. R is very literal.</p>
      <p>You'll see from the output of shapiro.test() that p is 0.1131, so we
        pass the normality assumption. </p>
      <p>This style of referring to a column in a data set - with the name of
        the data set followed by the name of the variable, separated by a dollar
        sign - is common, but not the only way available. We can refer to parts
        of a data set with a [row, column] index instead, like so (enter this in
        the <strong>console</strong> - in general, when I want you to try out
        something to learn how a function works, I'll have you type it into the
        console, and when I want it to be in your assignment I'll have you write
        it into a code chunk in your Rmd file) :</p>
      <p class="rcmd">shapiro.test(onesample[ , 1])</p>
      <p>Leaving the row number blank tells R to use all of the rows, but the 1
        in the column index tells R to use the first column in onesample for the
        test. Finally, we can use the with() command to identify the data set,
        and then nest the shapiro.test() command within it, like so (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(onesample, shapiro.test(Body.temperature))</p>
      <p>I personally prefer the first or third method, because they make the
        commands easier to understand - both the name of the data set and the
        name of the variable appear in them, and it's clear which is which,
        whereas just using the index number omits the name of the variable from
        the command and makes it less clear what is going on.</p>
      <p>2. Before conducting a one-sample t-test, look at your data! A good
        choice for small to medium sized data sets (100 observations or less) is
        a "strip chart", which plots the individual data points (much like
        MINITAB's individual value plots). To make one, use the command (in your
        <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stripchart(onesample$Body.temperature, xlab =
        "Temperature")</p>
      <p>You should have a plot that shows each individual data value along a
        horizontal line. The xlab argument sets the x-axis label.</p>
      <p>Another good type of graph to use to see the distribution of the data
        is a box plot, which you can get with (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">boxplot(onesample$Body.temperature, ylab = "Temperature")</p>
      <p>Box plots show the smallest and largest non-extreme data values as <strong>whiskers</strong>,
        and three <strong>quartiles</strong> (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) as a box
        with a line in the middle. Quartiles are the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th
        percentiles, meaning that they are the values below which 25%, 50%, 75%,
        and 100% of the data values fall. The 2nd quartile is also called the
        median, and the 4th quartile is the maximum data value. The difference
        between the 3rd and 1st quartile is called the <strong>interquartile
          range</strong>, and if there are any data values that are more than
        1.5 times the interquartile range away from the bottom or top of the box
        they are considered <strong>extreme</strong> values. Extreme values are
        not necessarily errors, but they can cause problems for data analysis
        and boxplots flag them by plotting them with circles below the lower
        whisker or above the upper one. You can see there is one extreme value
        below the lower whisker, but none above, so the circle is the minimum,
        and the upper whisker is the maximum for the data set.</p>
      <p>3. Now you're ready to conduct the one-sample t-test. The command is
        (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6)</p>
      <p>Output is reported below the code chunk, and should look like <a href="onesample_output.png">this.</a></p>
      <p>This command requires a data set to work on, and a numeric value to
        compare the sample mean of the data against - the first argument is the
        data set, and mu = designates the numeric value that the mean of the
        dataset will be compared against.</p>
      <p>One of the choices we need to make when we do hypothesis testing is
        whether we want to do <strong>one-tailed</strong> or <strong>two-tailed
          testing</strong>. If we do one-tailed testing we are only interested
        in detecting a difference in a particular direction - if we were
        measuring these temperatures to find out if studying statistics raised
        body temperatures we would only be interested in whether the sample mean
        is higher than 98.6, but since a value of 98.6 or anything less than
        98.6 would indicate that statistics doesn't raise body temperature we
        would only need to test for higher than expected means. To test just for
        a change in one direction we could do a one-tailed test. If instead
        we're checking whether 98.6 is an accurate normal body temperature, then
        differences that are either above or below the mean are of interest, and
        we would use a two-tailed test. We specify whether we are doing a
        one-tailed or two-tailed test by specifying the alternative hypothesis -
        if we are only interested in testing for increases in body temperature
        we would use the command (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(onesample$Body.temperature, mu = 98.6, alternative
        = "greater")</p>
      <p>The default is to do two-tailed testing, so we don't need to specify an
        alternative if we are interested in whether the sample mean is different
        from the null value in either direction.</p>
      <p>If this distinction still does not make sense to you, read the review
        material on one-sample t-tests, linked at the top of the page.</p>
      <h2 id="two-sample_t" class="part">Two-sample t-test</h2>
      <p>Charles Darwin was not only an important theoretician, he conducted
        many experiments to test his ideas on evolution by natural selection. In
        the review_data.xls file, on the sheet called "twosample", you have some
        of Darwin's data on an experiment comparing the heights of a species of
        plant, the "mignonette", that can reproduce either by self-pollinating,
        or by using pollen from other individuals. Darwin experimentally
        self-pollinated some plants and crossed others, and collected the
        resulting seed. He then planted seeds from each pollination treatment
        group, and measured the heights of the offspring. </p>
      <p>You now have data from two different groups, and would like to know if
        their means are different enough to conclude they come from statistical
        populations with different means - remember, the sample means are almost
        certainly not identical, but that's not what we are testing (why would
        we test if the sample means are different when they obviously are not?).</p>
      <p>1. In your R markdown file enter the import command needed to import
        the sheet called "twosample" from the file "review_data.xls" into a data
        set called "twosample" (add this to your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).
        I won't give you the commands, start with the command you used above and
        modify it to work for the twosample worksheet. </p>
      <p>Once twosample is in your environment, click on it to open the data set
        for viewing.</p>
      <p>You'll see that we have two variables: <strong>Height</strong> (the
        height of the plants in cm) and <strong>Pollination</strong> (a
        grouping variable indicating if the plant was crossed or selfed). This
        arrangement of data, with groups indicated by a column called a
        "factor", is referred to as "stacked" data, and it's the arrangement we
        will use throughout the class.</p>
      <p>2. To make a strip chart of the height data grouped by pollination use
        the command (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stripchart(Height ~ Pollination, data = twosample)</p>
      <p>Note that this command allows us to use a <strong>formula</strong>
        statement to say that we want to plot Height as a function of
        Pollination group, with the tilde character (hold down SHIFT and hit the
        key to the left of the 1 on your keyboard) taking the place of an equal
        sign. This style of formula statement is very common in R, we will be
        using it a lot.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The tilde is used instead of an equal symbol because the equal symbol
          is also used for assignment in R. Like the &lt;- assignment operator =
          assigns anything on the right side to the object on the left.</p>
        <p>What if we want to make a comparison in R? Usually we would ask if a
          = b, but we can't do that because that would assign the value of b to
          a. In R, we make comparisons with two equal symbols - to compare a to
          be we would use a == b</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The second argument in the t.test() function identifies the data set,
        so we don't need to use twosample$Height or twosample$Pollination to
        identify the data set to use.</p>
      <p>To make a box plot for these data use the command (in your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">boxplot(Height ~ Pollination, data = twosample, ylab =
        "Height (cm)")</p>
      <p>This command also uses the formula notation to group the heights by
        pollination group, and then adds an argument to set the label on the
        y-axis to "Height (cm)".</p>
      <p>3. We need to test the data for normality, but we need to do this by
        group - if the two pollination types have a different mean then the data
        may be bimodal when the groups are combined, even though they are normal
        when they are split.</p>
      <p>R is able to apply functions to subsets of data using the tapply()
        function. The tapply() function takes a column of data as its first
        argument, a grouping variable as its second argument, and a function to
        be applied to each group as the third. We can do Shapiro-Wilk tests on
        each pollination group using (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, tapply(Height, Pollination, shapiro.test))</p>
      <p>You will see that R reports two different tests, one for each
        pollination group. We pass for both of them.</p>
      <p>4. Now we should test the assumption of equal variances. Equal
        variances between groups is an assumption of the test, meaning that we
        can only trust our test of differences between the means to be accurate
        if we have equal variances (equal variances is not the biologically
        interesting question, therefore, we're just testing whether it's okay to
        use the t-test). </p>
      <p>To run Bartlett's test of homogeneity of variances (HOV) use the
        function (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(twosample, bartlett.test(Height, Pollination))</p>
      <p>If you fail to reject that hypothesis (that is, if p &gt; 0.05),
        consider the variances the same. </p>
      <p>5. Now that we know that we meet the normality and HOV assumptions we
        can test for differences in mean height between groups. The same
        function is used, but with different arguments (in your <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">t.test(Height ~ Pollination, var.equal = TRUE,
        data=twosample)</p>
      <p>This version of the t.test() function says that Height is a function of
        Pollination group, that the test should assume equal variances, and that
        the data set containing the variables is twosample.</p>
      <p>Note that in addition to the p-value, R reports a confidence interval
        for the difference between the means. If it has a negative lower bound
        and a positive upper bound the difference between the populations could
        be zero, and you would fail to reject the null. If it has two negative
        or two positive bounds then zero is not included in the interval, and
        you could reject the null.</p>
      <h2 id="paired_t" class="part">Paired t-test</h2>
      <p>A classic paired data set is one in which the same experimental
        subjects are observed in two different experimental conditions. You will
        use data on CO2 uptake by a single set of 12 plants grown in two
        different ambient CO2 concentrations (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The goal is
        to compare the uptake between these two concentrations, but since each
        of 12 plants are tested at each concentration, we would expect the
        uptake values not to be independent, because uptake at 250 ppm and at
        500 ppm are likely to be more similar for the same plant than for other
        plants in the data set. This causes two different problems: a) if we
        treat the observations as independent, we will use a greater degrees of
        freedom than we actually have, which will make our p-values inaccurate,
        and b) a small but consistent increase in uptake from 250 ppm to 500 ppm
        could be obscured by a large amount of variation among plants. We will
        use a paired t-test to correct for this lack of independence, and solve
        both of these problems.</p>
      <p>1. Import the sheet called "paired" into an R data set also called
        "paired" (put the needed command into your <strong>R markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>2. We should look at the data, but we have a small problem - our charts
        want the data to be in a stacked arrangement, but these data are
        arranged side by side to facilitate the paired t-test. Stacking the data
        would mean putting both sets of uptake values in a single column, with a
        second column that indicates the CO2 treatment. R has a function that
        does this for us (enter in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3))</p>
      <p>This command takes the data set to be stacked as the first argument,
        and a <strong>vector</strong> of column numbers that should be stacked.
        Vectors are a single row or a single column of values, and R creates
        them using the c() command. The first column of the data set is just a
        plant ID label, which we don't need to plot, so we are just stacking the
        second and third columns. You'll see the result in the console.</p>
      <p>We have a small problem that we are only seeing the result in the
        console - a new data set is not created, because we didn't <strong>assign</strong>
        the result to a new object. We can fix this by recalling the command you
        just issued using the up arrow key, and then modifying the command like
        so (in the <strong>R markdown file</strong>, paired.stack chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">stack(paired, c(2,3)) -&gt; co2.stacked</p>
      <p>When you assign output to an object it is not reported below the code
        chunk, but you should now see an object called co2.stacked in your
        environment. To see it in the console you can write its name at the
        command prompt (in the <strong>console</strong>): </p>
      <p class="rcmd">co2.stacked</p>
      <p>and its contents will be displayed. If you click once on co2.stacked in
        the Environment tab it will open in a data viewer tab so you can scroll
        through the data.</p>
      <p>3. The column names are not very useful - stack() assigned the name
        "value" for the uptake data, and "ind" (short for "index") for the CO2
        treatment. We can use the command colnames() to extract the column names
        that are currently assigned (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked)</p>
      <p>which will display the column names in the console. We can also use
        colnames() to change the names to other values with the command (in the
        <strong>R markdown file</strong>, paired.stack chunk, in the line below
        your stack() function):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">colnames(co2.stacked) &lt;- c("Uptake", "Treatment")</p>
      <p>This command assigns a vector with "Uptake" and "Treatment" as the
        column names for co2.stacked. If you have the stacked data open in a
        viewer you'll see the column names update to these new values.</p>
      <p>4. You now have a data set that you can use to make a strip chart and a
        box plot by group, so do so (in your <strong>R markdown file</strong>)
        - use the command you used for the two sample dataset as an example, and
        modify it to work with this stacked dataset. </p>
      <p>You'll see that both of these plots show a small difference in the
        distribution of the data, but with lots of overlap. Remember, though,
        that the data are measurements of the same plants under two different
        CO2 concentrations, and the we're really only interested in whether each
        plant changes their CO2 uptake when the environment changes - we just
        need to know if the differences between plants are different from 0 on
        average.</p>
      <p>To get differences, we can use R's ability to operations on entire
        vectors of data - we can calculate differences between the two different
        CO2 treatments with the command (in the <strong>console</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250)</p>
      <p>The differences between each row of the paired data set is shown in the
        console. To add these differences back into the paired data set, recall
        the command and change it to (in the <strong>R markdown file</strong>,
        paired.diffs chunk):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, uptake_500 - uptake_250) -&gt; paired$diffs</p>
      <p>Your paired data set now has an additional column called "diffs",
        containing the differences. If you click on the data file name you'll
        see the new column.</p>
      <p>You can do a boxplot of these differences, and you'll see that all of
        them are positive (in the <strong>R markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>5. To check the normality assumption of a paired t-test, conduct a
        Shapiro-Wilk test on the differences you just calculated (in the <strong>R
          markdown file</strong>).</p>
      <p>6. Now that you know you meet the normality assumption, conduct a
        paired t-test using the same function, but with different options (in
        the <strong>R markdown file</strong>):</p>
      <p class="rcmd">with(paired, t.test(uptake_250, uptake_500, paired =
        TRUE)) </p>
      <p>The paired t-test compares the mean of the differences between the two
        columns of data against 0, using a one-sample t-test.</p>
      <p>Note that since we calculated the differences for plotting and to check
        normality we could just as easily have done this analysis as a
        one-sample t-test. In the <strong>console</strong> see if you can do a
        one-sample t-test on the diffs, and confirm that the results are the
        same as you obtained using the paired t-test (same df, same t-value,
        same p-value).</p>
      <h2>Knit the output file</h2>
      <p>When you are done with the exercise, your R markdown file can be "knit"
        into a Microsoft Word document, which will contain all the code you used
        and all the output, formatted nicely into a report. You can open the
        file, edit it, annotate it if you like, and it will be this file you
        upload to complete the assignment.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is to find the "Knit" button above the R markdown
        window, <img src="knit.png" alt="Knit">. Clicking this once will create
        the default Word document (which is specified in the header of your
        markdown file), but if you click and hold you'll see that you can use
        the same markdown file to make other types of files, such as a web page
        (html), or a pdf document.</p>
      <p>You want a Word file though, so click the Knit button once to create
        it. The first time you do this R Studio may ask to install some
        additional packages - let it do so, and when it's done it will knit the
        file. The file will be in the same project folder as review_data.xls and
        review1.Rmd, and it will be called review1.docx (it will appear in the
        Files tab). RStudio will also open Word so you can see the document -
        it's very pretty.</p>
      <p>Upload this review1.docx file to the course web site to complete the
        assignment. Don't worry about making the filename different to identify
        that it's yours - the file has your name in it and will be attached to
        your account on the class web site - sticking with the default
        review1.docx file name is fine.</p>
      <h2 id="r_help" class="part">Additional help with R</h2>
      <p>There are several good, free tutorials on R. A good place to look for
        them is the CRAN web site - go to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</a>,
        and find the "Documentation" links on the left side of the page. The
        "Manuals" are meant as complete references, but are not written as
        tutorials. The "Contributed" documentation section gives several good
        introductory documents that you can check out. Some particularly newbie
        friendly ones are "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf">R
          for Beginners</a>", and "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lemon-kickstart/index.html">Kickstarting
          R</a>". Another good, fairly comprehensive document that uses
        biological examples is "<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Seefeld_StatsRBio.pdf">Statistics
using
          biological examples</a>".</p>
      <p> The graphical interface we're using, R Commander, is a "contributed
        package" that isn't a standard part of R. Consequently, it will most
        likely not appear in the tutorials linked above. If you want to learn
        more about how to use it, you can try "<a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/Getting-Started-with-the-Rcmdr.pdf">Getting
